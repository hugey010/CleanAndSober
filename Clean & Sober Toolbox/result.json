You probably will forget what's troubling you, but you probably won't forget if you let the symptoms of depression make you drink, eat, drug, spend hours on the internet, ruin your sleep, make you lose interest in things you used to enjoy, and otherwise ruin your day. Most times, it is the initial shock that hurts when we are confronted with an issue. Often, it is a little thing that starts us spiraling downward. It is important to not \"sweat the small stuff\". It is important to nip bad feelings in the bud.  </p>\n<p class=\"p3\">           <span class=\"Apple-converted-space\"> </span></p>\n<p class=\"p3\">           TO DO: You should use a <b>recovery tool</b> to get over the shock and forget what's bothering you, like sharing the problem with a friend, going to a meeting, journaling, deep breathing and more. Writing down something that bothers you and throwing it in the trash might help. Don't sweep your problems under the rug, deal with them one at a time. But there is a time to forget about them. Writing down 5 things you are grateful for (like being able to walk, living in a safe place, having food, etc.) may change your attitude.</p>\n<p class=\"p2\"><br></p>\n<p class=\"p4\"><br></p>\n</body>\n</html>\n",

No matter how much you think you can control your feelings, no matter how well adjusted you think you are, no matter how well you like the 12 steps, every now and then something will happen that will upset you. The key is to not let that bird build a nest in your head. People, places, and things cannot control your emotions. They are just emotional triggers. Remember, you make yourself feel a certain way in response to the trigger. You can also quickly change how you respond.</p>\n<p class=\"p4\"><br></p>\n<p class=\"p3\"><span class=\"Apple-tab-span\">\t</span>TO DO:<span class=\"Apple-converted-space\">  </span>What's a good way to get that bird to fly away? One way is to try to recognize your feeling, and then to try to change the bad feeling to a positive feeling. To do so, you can start by using this app. You can also ask yourself if the trigger is worth being upset about. You can also try applying the 12 steps to the feeling. First, admit that you are powerless to handle it alone. Then, turn the problem over to a Higher Power. That Higher Power may be a consultation with a sponsor, a therapist, or your God.<span class=\"Apple-converted-space\">  </span>Maybe take an inventory and see where your own sensitivity may be contributing to the problem. If you can determine what the character sensitivity or issue is, tell someone else. If you can't determine what it is, discuss the situation with someone else. Try to find<span class=\"Apple-converted-space\">  </span><span class=\"s1\">your </span>defect and not the defect in the person you think is causing the problem. Once you find the defect, ask God to remove it.</p>\n<p class=\"p3\"><span class=\"Apple-tab-span\">\t</span>If the problem causes resentment, pray for the person who you think is causing the resentment.<span class=\"Apple-converted-space\"> </span></p>\n<p class=\"p3\"><span class=\"Apple-tab-span\">\t</span><span class=\"Apple-converted-space\">    </span>Remember to ask God that His will be done, not yours. And most importantly, try to help someone who is new to recovery. By getting out of yourself and helping another, you may be grateful that your problem is not as bad as the other person. You may gain perspective. Your attention will be re-focused.<span class=\"Apple-converted-space\">  </span>By doing what it takes to get the bird off your head, you will avoid finding yourself saying, <b>\"If I get drunk, I won't be able to think about it.\"</b></p>\n<p class=\"p5\"><br></p>\n</body>\n</html>\n",

The snakes are bills, bosses, complicated financial news, health insurance issues, friends committing suicide, etc. Our bodies initial responses are to fight or flight. Both of these responses only escalate the problem, escalate the stress, and escalate the risk of relapse.</p>\n<p class=\"p2\"><span class=\"Apple-tab-span\">\t</span>When given shocking news that appears threatening, the first step to sobriety is just absorbing the blow, and not reacting. No need to immediately intellectualize a response; just absorb it until the instinct to fight or flight passes. If these instincts don't pass, call someone safe like a sponsor or friend to discuss the problem. This strategy will keep the problem from becoming trouble. Fight or flight does not work as well as compromise.</p>\n<p class=\"p2\">To Do: Imagine the shock is a snake. Most snakes are harmless. In any event, you don't need to run away or lash out at it. Just gently support your head and breathe slowly and the snake will be hypnotized. We can't do anything productive in shock. We must let it pass. Only when the instinct to fight or flee passes can we think of a rational, sober solution to a problem. According to As Bill Sees It, page 250,<span class=\"Apple-converted-space\">  </span>Bill W. used to lengthen his daily walks and slowly repeat the Serenity Prayer in rhythm to his steps and breathing when under acute tension.</p>\n<p class=\"p3\"><br></p>\n</body>\n</html>\n",

Always test your first thought by thinking of its consequences (good and bad) and always think of possible alternative thoughts before you act.

For example, usually our first thought when confronted with stress, anger or some other negative emotion is to lash out, withdraw, or escape by picking up our first drug of choice. This just causes more conflict, stress, anger and resentment. We consequently regret acting upon our first thoughts. Acting upon our first thought is called a <i>reaction.<span class=\"Apple-converted-space\">  </span></i>In recovery, we learn to \"act upon\", not react, and this makes our lives easier.

Addicts tend to be control freaks. We think we know what's right and how to do it and what everyone else should do. We want to run the show. Often with the best of intentions, we tell people what to do. The only problem is that we forget that they usually don't want to hear what we have to say- especially if we are newly sober because we have made such a mess out of our own lives that we have nothing to back up what we are saying.</p>\n<p class=\"p3\"><span class=\"Apple-tab-span\">\t</span>The twelve steps teach us that we are not in charge- that everyone (including ourselves) is much better off if we turn our control over to our Higher Power.<span class=\"Apple-converted-space\">  </span>Usually, this means that we just try to do what's in front of us without controlling people, places or things. Rather, we should just accept what is and remember everything is not about us or our way.</p>\n<p class=\"p3\"><span class=\"Apple-tab-span\">\t</span>Getting out of the way means letting go of our need to control things we cannot.

A good way to relax is to ask yourself if you really are in trouble or is it just your anxious brain talking? Addicts overanalyze. We worry about outcomes. We try to control what we cannot. We tend to think negatively. We tend to ignore good things, and dwell on bad things. Addicts use and act out to try to change their irritating brains. Unfortunately, substances and addictive behaviors not only change our brains but cause us to break laws, end up in hospitals, lose God, and ruin relationships. A better way to change our brains is to surround ourselves with recovering people who care about us, exercise, eat correctly, practice the 12 steps, and share our secrets with Sponsors.</p>\n<p class=\"p2\"><br></p>\n<p class=\"p1\">To Do: Tell yourself to stop thinking. Get out of your head and into your heart. Instead reach out to help someone or do something to serve your Higher Power. Sometimes that service can be not making a problem worse or just taking a break for a peaceful walk or some other fun activity.</p>\n<p class=\"p2\"><br></p>\n<p class=\"p3\"><br></p>\n</body>\n</html>\n",

Once you have reached the top of your head, start noticing your surroundings. Then do your next daily activity, keeping your mind focused on what you are doing.

You probably will forget what's troubling you, but you probably won't forget if you let the symptoms of depression make you drink, eat, drug, spend hours on the internet, ruin your sleep, make you lose interest in things you used to enjoy, and otherwise ruin your day. Most times, it is the initial shock that hurts when we are confronted with an issue. Often, it is a little thing that starts us spiraling downward. It is important to not \"sweat the small stuff\". It is important to nip bad feelings in the bud.  </p>\n<p class=\"p3\">           <span class=\"Apple-converted-space\"> </span></p>\n<p class=\"p3\">           TO DO: You should use a <b>recovery tool</b> to get over the shock and forget what's bothering you, like sharing the problem with a friend, going to a meeting, journaling, deep breathing and more. Writing down something that bothers you and throwing it in the trash might help. Don't sweep your problems under the rug, deal with them one at a time. But there is a time to forget about them. Writing down 5 things you are grateful for (like being able to walk, living in a safe place, having food, etc.) may change your attitude.</p>\n<p class=\"p2\"><br></p>\n<p class=\"p4\"><br></p>\n</body>\n</html>\n",

Sometimes that service can be not making a problem worse or just taking a break for a peaceful walk or some other fun activity.</p>\n<p class=\"p2\"><br></p>\n<p class=\"p3\"><br></p>\n</body>\n</html>\n",

You probably will forget what's troubling you, but you probably won't forget if you let the symptoms of depression make you drink, eat, drug, spend hours on the internet, ruin your sleep, make you lose interest in things you used to enjoy, and otherwise ruin your day. Most times, it is the initial shock that hurts when we are confronted with an issue. Often, it is a little thing that starts us spiraling downward. It is important to not \"sweat the small stuff\". It is important to nip bad feelings in the bud.  </p>\n<p class=\"p3\">           <span class=\"Apple-converted-space\"> </span></p>\n<p class=\"p3\">           TO DO: You should use a <b>recovery tool</b> to get over the shock and forget what's bothering you, like sharing the problem with a friend, going to a meeting, journaling, deep breathing and more. Writing down something that bothers you and throwing it in the trash might help. Don't sweep your problems under the rug, deal with them one at a time. But there is a time to forget about them. Writing down 5 things you are grateful for (like being able to walk, living in a safe place, having food, etc.) may change your attitude.</p>\n<p class=\"p2\"><br></p>\n<p class=\"p4\"><br></p>\n</body>\n</html>\n",

You probably will forget what's troubling you, but you probably won't forget if you let the symptoms of depression make you drink, eat, drug, spend hours on the internet, ruin your sleep, make you lose interest in things you used to enjoy, and otherwise ruin your day. Most times, it is the initial shock that hurts when we are confronted with an issue. Often, it is a little thing that starts us spiraling downward. It is important to not \"sweat the small stuff\". It is important to nip bad feelings in the bud.  </p>\n<p class=\"p3\">           <span class=\"Apple-converted-space\"> </span></p>\n<p class=\"p3\">           TO DO: You should use a <b>recovery tool</b> to get over the shock and forget what's bothering you, like sharing the problem with a friend, going to a meeting, journaling, deep breathing and more. Writing down something that bothers you and throwing it in the trash might help. Don't sweep your problems under the rug, deal with them one at a time. But there is a time to forget about them. Writing down 5 things you are grateful for (like being able to walk, living in a safe place, having food, etc.) may change your attitude.</p>\n<p class=\"p2\"><br></p>\n<p class=\"p4\"><br></p>\n</body>\n</html>\n",

You are like that baseball in that you have layer after layer of fears and resentments that are strangling your core (your true self). Your core can deal with reality; but your addiction consists of the layers of fears and resentments which make your core impotent. Once you cut through those layers by doing the 12 steps (particularly 4-7 and a daily 10<sup>th</sup>), you will free your core.<span class=\"Apple-converted-space\">  </span>And you will find that your core is this joyous being that can deal quite happily with reality without drugs.</p>\n<p class=\"p2\"><br></p>\n<p class=\"p4\">TO DO: Don't let your core strangle. Do a fourth step, a \"searching and fearless\" moral inventory to discover all your fears and resentments which are strangling your wonderful core. Then do a fifth step by admitting those fears and resentments to yourself, your Higher Power, and another trusted human being. This will free your core. And remember to do this process on a daily basis (the 10<sup>th</sup> step), so that you can keep your core free when new fears and resentments creep back into your life.</p>\n</body>\n</html>\n",

No matter how much you think you can control your feelings, no matter how well adjusted you think you are, no matter how well you like the 12 steps, every now and then something will happen that will upset you. The key is to not let that bird build a nest in your head. People, places, and things cannot control your emotions. They are just emotional triggers. Remember, you make yourself feel a certain way in response to the trigger. You can also quickly change how you respond.</p>\n<p class=\"p4\"><br></p>\n<p class=\"p3\"><span class=\"Apple-tab-span\">\t</span>TO DO:<span class=\"Apple-converted-space\">  </span>What's a good way to get that bird to fly away? One way is to try to recognize your feeling, and then to try to change the bad feeling to a positive feeling. To do so, you can start by using this app. You can also ask yourself if the trigger is worth being upset about. You can also try applying the 12 steps to the feeling. First, admit that you are powerless to handle it alone. Then, turn the problem over to a Higher Power. That Higher Power may be a consultation with a sponsor, a therapist, or your God.<span class=\"Apple-converted-space\">  </span>Maybe take an inventory and see where your own sensitivity may be contributing to the problem. If you can determine what the character sensitivity or issue is, tell someone else. If you can't determine what it is, discuss the situation with someone else. Try to find<span class=\"Apple-converted-space\">  </span><span class=\"s1\">your </span>defect and not the defect in the person you think is causing the problem. Once you find the defect, ask God to remove it.</p>\n<p class=\"p3\"><span class=\"Apple-tab-span\">\t</span>If the problem causes resentment, pray for the person who you think is causing the resentment.<span class=\"Apple-converted-space\"> </span></p>\n<p class=\"p3\"><span class=\"Apple-tab-span\">\t</span><span class=\"Apple-converted-space\">    </span>Remember to ask God that His will be done, not yours. And most importantly, try to help someone who is new to recovery. By getting out of yourself and helping another, you may be grateful that your problem is not as bad as the other person. You may gain perspective. Your attention will be re-focused.<span class=\"Apple-converted-space\">  </span>By doing what it takes to get the bird off your head, you will avoid finding yourself saying, <b>\"If I get drunk, I won't be able to think about it.\"</b></p>\n<p class=\"p5\"><br></p>\n</body>\n</html>\n",

Both of these responses only escalate the problem, escalate the stress, and escalate the risk of relapse.</p>\n<p class=\"p2\"><span class=\"Apple-tab-span\">\t</span>When given shocking news that appears threatening, the first step to sobriety is just absorbing the blow, and not reacting. No need to immediately intellectualize a response; just absorb it until the instinct to fight or flight passes. If these instincts don't pass, call someone safe like a sponsor or friend to discuss the problem. This strategy will keep the problem from becoming trouble. Fight or flight does not work as well as compromise.</p>\n<p class=\"p2\">To Do: Imagine the shock is a snake. Most snakes are harmless. In any event, you don't need to run away or lash out at it. Just gently support your head and breathe slowly and the snake will be hypnotized. We can't do anything productive in shock. We must let it pass. Only when the instinct to fight or flee passes can we think of a rational, sober solution to a problem.</p>\n<p class=\"p3\"><br></p>\n</body>\n</html>\n",

Addicts tend to be control freaks. We think we know what's right and how to do it and what everyone else should do. We want to run the show. Often with the best of intentions, we tell people what to do. The only problem is that we forget that they usually don't want to hear what we have to say- especially if we are newly sober because we have made such a mess out of our own lives that we have nothing to back up what we are saying.</p>\n<p class=\"p3\"><span class=\"Apple-tab-span\">\t</span>The twelve steps teach us that we are not in charge- that everyone (including ourselves) is much better off if we turn our control over to our Higher Power.<span class=\"Apple-converted-space\">  </span>Usually, this means that we just try to do what's in front of us without controlling people, places or things. Rather, we should just accept what is and remember everything is not about us or our way.</p>\n<p class=\"p3\"><span class=\"Apple-tab-span\">\t</span>Getting out of the way means letting go of our need to control things we cannot. This keeps us from picking up the first drink because we lose the frustration that comes with doing the impossible. We can then accept life without drinking to escape from not getting our way.</p>\n<p class=\"p4\"><span class=\"Apple-tab-span\">\t</span></p>\n<p class=\"p3\">TO DO: Say to yourself: I will get out of the way and let my Higher Power handle the results.<span class=\"Apple-converted-space\"> </span></p>\n<p class=\"p4\"><br></p>\n<p class=\"p5\"><br></p>\n</body>\n</html>\n",

A good way to relax is to ask yourself if you really are in trouble or is it just your anxious brain talking? Addicts overanalyze. We worry about outcomes. We try to control what we cannot. We tend to think negatively. We tend to ignore good things, and dwell on bad things. Addicts use and act out to try to change their irritating brains. Unfortunately, substances and addictive behaviors not only change our brains but cause us to break laws, end up in hospitals, lose God, and ruin relationships. A better way to change our brains is to surround ourselves with recovering people who care about us, exercise, eat correctly, practice the 12 steps, and share our secrets with Sponsors.</p>\n<p class=\"p2\"><br></p>\n<p class=\"p1\">To Do: Tell yourself to stop thinking. Get out of your head and into your heart. Instead reach out to help someone or do something to serve your Higher Power. Sometimes that service can be not making a problem worse or just taking a break for a peaceful walk or some other fun activity.</p>\n<p class=\"p2\"><br></p>\n<p class=\"p3\"><br></p>\n</body>\n</html>\n",

Exercise mindfulness. Mindfulness means that you are slowly breathing and keeping your mind in the moment. Start by looking at your feet, squeezing your foot muscles, then slowly working your way upward. Take your time, breathing slowly. Once you have reached the top of your head, start noticing your surroundings. Then do your next daily activity, keeping your mind focused on what you are doing. Don't live in the future or the past.</p>\n<p class=\"p3\"><br></p>\n<p class=\"p4\"><br></p>\n</body>\n</html>\n",

Think about how you used to handle it while you were using. Not a good result huh?</p>\n<p class=\"p2\"><span class=\"Apple-tab-span\">\t</span>Now, ask yourself what step (of the 12 steps) can I apply to this issue. It might be a good idea to start with step 4 to see what character defect is causing you to struggle. Then you might need to get rid of that defect by doing steps 5-7. Usually over controlling is a problem, so step 1 applies: powerlessness over people, places, and things.</p>\n<p class=\"p3\"><br></p>\n<p class=\"p4\">To Do: Live the steps and apply each step beginning with step one to specific issues. This will reduce stress and help you make better decisions. It will also keep little things from building up, overwhelming you, frustrating you, confusing you and leading you to want to escape by using.</p>\n</body>\n</html>\n",

You probably will forget what's troubling you, but you probably won't forget if you let the symptoms of depression make you drink, eat, drug, spend hours on the internet, ruin your sleep, make you lose interest in things you used to enjoy, and otherwise ruin your day. Most times, it is the initial shock that hurts when we are confronted with an issue. Often, it is a little thing that starts us spiraling downward. It is important to not \"sweat the small stuff\". It is important to nip bad feelings in the bud.  </p>\n<p class=\"p3\">           <span class=\"Apple-converted-space\"> </span></p>\n<p class=\"p3\">           TO DO: You should use a <b>recovery tool</b> to get over the shock and forget what's bothering you, like sharing the problem with a friend, going to a meeting, journaling, deep breathing and more. Writing down something that bothers you and throwing it in the trash might help. Don't sweep your problems under the rug, deal with them one at a time. But there is a time to forget about them. Writing down 5 things you are grateful for (like being able to walk, living in a safe place, having food, etc.) may change your attitude.</p>\n<p class=\"p2\"><br></p>\n<p class=\"p4\"><br></p>\n</body>\n</html>\n",

If you've never seen the inside of a baseball, it is tightly wound around a tiny rock hard center. You are like that baseball in that you have layer after layer of fears and resentments that are strangling your core (your true self). Your core can deal with reality; but your addiction consists of the layers of fears and resentments which make your core impotent. Once you cut through those layers by doing the 12 steps (particularly 4-7 and a daily 10<sup>th</sup>), you will free your core.<span class=\"Apple-converted-space\">  </span>And you will find that your core is this joyous being that can deal quite happily with reality without drugs.</p>\n<p class=\"p2\"><br></p>\n<p class=\"p4\">TO DO: Don't let your core strangle. Do a fourth step, a \"searching and fearless\" moral inventory to discover all your fears and resentments which are strangling your wonderful core. Then do a fifth step by admitting those fears and resentments to yourself, your Higher Power, and another trusted human being. This will free your core. And remember to do this process on a daily basis (the 10<sup>th</sup> step), so that you can keep your core free when new fears and resentments creep back into your life.</p>\n</body>\n</html>\n",

Addicts tend to be control freaks. We think we know what's right and how to do it and what everyone else should do. We want to run the show. Often with the best of intentions, we tell people what to do. The only problem is that we forget that they usually don't want to hear what we have to say- especially if we are newly sober because we have made such a mess out of our own lives that we have nothing to back up what we are saying.</p>\n<p class=\"p3\"><span class=\"Apple-tab-span\">\t</span>The twelve steps teach us that we are not in charge- that everyone (including ourselves) is much better off if we turn our control over to our Higher Power.<span class=\"Apple-converted-space\">  </span>Usually, this means that we just try to do what's in front of us without controlling people, places or things. Rather, we should just accept what is and remember everything is not about us or our way.</p>\n<p class=\"p3\"><span class=\"Apple-tab-span\">\t</span>Getting out of the way means letting go of our need to control things we cannot. This keeps us from picking up the first drink because we lose the frustration that comes with doing the impossible. We can then accept life without drinking to escape from not getting our way.</p>\n<p class=\"p4\"><span class=\"Apple-tab-span\">\t</span></p>\n<p class=\"p3\">TO DO: Say to yourself: I will get out of the way and let my Higher Power handle the results.<span class=\"Apple-converted-space\"> </span></p>\n<p class=\"p4\"><br></p>\n<p class=\"p5\"><br></p>\n</body>\n</html>\n",

Learning is easier than faking knowing. Our addiction is tied to trying to look important. We drank and used because our egos wanted us to be more than what we were willing to accept. We had to put on facades, fake fronts to try to impress others. We tried to appear as if we knew it all, were totally in control, and were all powerful. But inside we knew differently so we escaped by using. The truth is that others knew we were frauds too. We ended up stressed out, full of fear, and humiliated. In recovery, we turn this humiliation into humility. We recognize that we can accept ourselves even though we are not as important as we thought we had to be. We learn to appreciate ourselves for who we are, not some egomaniacal version of who we would like to be and who we would like others to think we are. We become openminded to learning, and this actually makes us feel better.<span class=\"Apple-converted-space\"> </span></p>\n<p class=\"p2\"><br></p>\n<p class=\"p1\">To Do: Ask someone for help, and follow their suggestion.

How do we move away from our Higher Power?<span class=\"Apple-converted-space\">  </span>We do or think things that disconnect us from God. For example, disconnected thinking involves worry, resentment, fear, compulsivity, hate, anger, etc. Disconnected behaviors involve \" immature\" acting, sexual deviance, misrepresentations, physical abuse, verbal abuse, relapse, etc.<span class=\"Apple-tab-span\">\t</span></p>\n<p class=\"p3\"><span class=\"Apple-tab-span\">\t</span>It is challenging to stay spiritually connected if you stay surrounded by spiritual doubters so go to meetings to be around spiritual believers.</p>\n<p class=\"p4\"><br></p>\n<p class=\"p3\">TO DO: Ask God how you can do what God wants.

A good way to relax is to ask yourself if you really are in trouble or is it just your anxious brain talking? Addicts overanalyze. We worry about outcomes. We try to control what we cannot. We tend to think negatively. We tend to ignore good things, and dwell on bad things. Addicts use and act out to try to change their irritating brains. Unfortunately, substances and addictive behaviors not only change our brains but cause us to break laws, end up in hospitals, lose God, and ruin relationships. A better way to change our brains is to surround ourselves with recovering people who care about us, exercise, eat correctly, practice the 12 steps, and share our secrets with Sponsors.</p>\n<p class=\"p2\"><br></p>\n<p class=\"p1\">To Do: Tell yourself to stop thinking. Get out of your head and into your heart. Instead reach out to help someone or do something to serve your Higher Power.

Once you have reached the top of your head, start noticing your surroundings. Then do your next daily activity, keeping your mind focused on what you are doing.

It will try to tell you you're cured so you can have just one. A key to sobriety is recognizing and doing the opposite of that voice. Your addict voice causes you fear and stress. It takes a personality change to keep the addict voice quiet.</p>\n<p class=\"p2\"><br></p>\n<p class=\"p1\">To Do: Listen to the addict voice as you go through your day and substitute its advice with your recovery voice. Connect to your Higher Power and ask his help to change voices. This will keep you sober and at peace. Good for you for using this App to change voices!</p>\n<p class=\"p3\"><br></p>\n</body>\n</html>\n",

It might be a good idea to start with step 4 to see what character defect is causing you to struggle. Then you might need to get rid of that defect by doing steps 5-7.

It is important to nip bad feelings in the bud.  </p>\n<p class=\"p3\">           <span class=\"Apple-converted-space\"> </span></p>\n<p class=\"p3\">           TO DO: You should use a <b>recovery tool</b> to get over the shock and forget what's bothering you, like sharing the problem with a friend, going to a meeting, journaling, deep breathing and more. Writing down something that bothers you and throwing it in the trash might help. Don't sweep your problems under the rug, deal with them one at a time. But there is a time to forget about them. Writing down 5 things you are grateful for (like being able to walk, living in a safe place, having food, etc.) may change your attitude.</p>\n<p class=\"p2\"><br></p>\n<p class=\"p4\"><br></p>\n</body>\n</html>\n",

No matter how much you think you can control your feelings, no matter how well adjusted you think you are, no matter how well you like the 12 steps, every now and then something will happen that will upset you or trigger sadness. The key is to not let that bird build a nest in your head. People, places, and things cannot control your emotions. They are just emotional triggers. Remember, you make yourself feel a certain way in response to the trigger. You can also quickly change how you respond.</p>\n<p class=\"p4\"><br></p>\n<p class=\"p3\"><span class=\"Apple-tab-span\">\t</span>TO DO:<span class=\"Apple-converted-space\">  </span>What's a good way to get that bird to fly away? One way is to try to recognize your feeling, and then to try to change the bad feeling to a positive feeling. To do so, you can start by using this app. You can also ask yourself if the trigger is worth being upset about. You can also try applying the 12 steps to the feeling. First, admit that you are powerless to handle it alone. Then, turn the problem over to a Higher Power. That Higher Power may be a consultation with a sponsor, a therapist, or your God.<span class=\"Apple-converted-space\">  </span>Maybe take an inventory and see where your own sensitivity may be contributing to the problem. If you can determine what the character sensitivity or issue is, tell someone else. If you can't determine what it is, discuss the situation with someone else. Try to find<span class=\"Apple-converted-space\">  </span><span class=\"s1\">your </span>defect and not the defect in the person you think is causing the problem. Once you find the defect, ask God to remove it.</p>\n<p class=\"p3\"><span class=\"Apple-tab-span\">\t</span>If the problem causes resentment, pray for the person who you think is causing the resentment.<span class=\"Apple-converted-space\"> </span></p>\n<p class=\"p3\"><span class=\"Apple-tab-span\">\t</span><span class=\"Apple-converted-space\">    </span>Remember to ask God that His will be done, not yours. And most importantly, try to help someone who is new to recovery. By getting out of yourself and helping another, you may be grateful that your problem is not as bad as the other person. You may gain perspective. Your attention will be re-focused.<span class=\"Apple-converted-space\">  </span>By doing what it takes to get the bird off your head, you will avoid finding yourself saying, <b>\"If I get drunk, I won't be able to think about it.\"</b></p>\n<p class=\"p5\"><br></p>\n</body>\n</html>\n",

A good way to relax is to ask yourself if you really are in trouble or is it just your anxious brain talking? Addicts overanalyze. We worry about outcomes. We try to control what we cannot. We tend to think negatively. We tend to ignore good things, and dwell on bad things. Addicts use and act out to try to change their irritating brains. Unfortunately, substances and addictive behaviors not only change our brains but cause us to break laws, end up in hospitals, lose God, and ruin relationships. A better way to change our brains is to surround ourselves with recovering people who care about us, exercise, eat correctly, practice the 12 steps, and share our secrets with Sponsors.</p>\n<p class=\"p2\"><br></p>\n<p class=\"p1\">To Do: Tell yourself to stop thinking. Get out of your head and into your heart. Instead reach out to help someone or do something to serve your Higher Power. Sometimes that service can be not making a problem worse or just taking a break for a peaceful walk or some other fun activity.</p>\n<p class=\"p2\"><br></p>\n<p class=\"p3\"><br></p>\n</body>\n</html>\n",

While holding down the \"program\" button, I pressed the \"advance time\" button, but the time did not change. There was no way I was doing the procedure incorrectly. But the time would not set. Therefore, I could not program the coffee maker to have my precious coffee ready when I woke up. Another example: a troubled client sends me a threatening email on the first day of my vacation. Another example: a young couple is told that they can never have children.<span class=\"Apple-converted-space\"> </span></p>\n<p class=\"p2\"><br></p>\n<p class=\"p1\">From little issues like my coffee maker not working to life challenges like being told you can never have children, there are times when you cannot fix a problem, you can only deal with it so that it does not destroy your serenity or the manageability of your life. There are times when events are going to be a trigger for sadness or self pity.</p>\n<p class=\"p2\"><br></p>\n<p class=\"p1\">To Do: Practice acceptance, not judgment. Although unexpected and unfair, accept that each of us must deal with adversity. Don't feel like you must bear sadness alone. Ask friends and therapists for guidance and support. Create a plan to deal with adversity. Perhaps, you will have to be a bit more patient to deal with an unexpected problem. Perhaps you will have to reprioritize certain life goals to best play the new deck of cards you have been given.</p>\n<p class=\"p3\"><br></p>\n</body>\n</html>\n",

A good way to relax is to ask yourself if you really are in trouble or is it just your anxious brain talking? Addicts overanalyze. We worry about outcomes. We try to control what we cannot. We tend to think negatively. We tend to ignore good things, and dwell on bad things. Addicts use and act out to try to change their irritating brains. Unfortunately, substances and addictive behaviors not only change our brains but cause us to break laws, end up in hospitals, lose God, and ruin relationships. A better way to change our brains is to surround ourselves with recovering people who care about us, exercise, eat correctly, practice the 12 steps, and share our secrets with Sponsors.</p>\n<p class=\"p2\"><br></p>\n<p class=\"p1\">To Do: Tell yourself to stop thinking. Get out of your head and into your heart. Instead reach out to help someone or do something to serve your Higher Power. Sometimes that service can be not making a problem worse or just taking a break for a peaceful walk or some other fun activity.</p>\n<p class=\"p2\"><br></p>\n<p class=\"p3\"><br></p>\n</body>\n</html>\n",

Once we rebalance our ego, we will lose fear, anger and resentment because we won't be so obsessed with what happened, what is happening, or what will be happening to the almighty ME.

You probably will forget what's troubling you, but you probably won't forget if you let the symptoms of depression make you drink, eat, drug, spend hours on the internet, ruin your sleep, make you lose interest in things you used to enjoy, and otherwise ruin your day. Most times, it is the initial shock that hurts when we are confronted with an issue. Often, it is a little thing that starts us spiraling downward. It is important to not \"sweat the small stuff\". It is important to nip bad feelings in the bud.  </p>\n<p class=\"p3\">           <span class=\"Apple-converted-space\"> </span></p>\n<p class=\"p3\">           TO DO: You should use a <b>recovery tool</b> to get over the shock and forget what's bothering you, like sharing the problem with a friend, going to a meeting, journaling, deep breathing and more. Writing down something that bothers you and throwing it in the trash might help. Don't sweep your problems under the rug, deal with them one at a time. But there is a time to forget about them. Writing down 5 things you are grateful for (like being able to walk, living in a safe place, having food, etc.) may change your attitude.</p>\n<p class=\"p2\"><br></p>\n<p class=\"p4\"><br></p>\n</body>\n</html>\n",

You are like that baseball in that you have layer after layer of fears and resentments that are strangling your core (your true self). Your core can deal with reality; but your addiction consists of the layers of fears and resentments which make your core impotent.

Do a fourth step, a \"searching and fearless\" moral inventory to discover all your fears and resentments which are strangling your wonderful core. Then do a fifth step by admitting those fears and resentments to yourself, your Higher Power, and another trusted human being. This will free your core. And remember to do this process on a daily basis (the 10<sup>th</sup> step), so that you can keep your core free when new fears and resentments creep back into your life.</p>\n</body>\n</html>\n",

No matter how much you think you can control your feelings, no matter how well adjusted you think you are, no matter how well you like the 12 steps, every now and then something will happen that will upset you. The key is to not let that bird build a nest in your head. People, places, and things cannot control your emotions. They are just emotional triggers. Remember, you make yourself feel a certain way in response to the trigger. You can also quickly change how you respond.</p>\n<p class=\"p4\"><br></p>\n<p class=\"p3\"><span class=\"Apple-tab-span\">\t</span>TO DO:<span class=\"Apple-converted-space\">  </span>What's a good way to get that bird to fly away? One way is to try to recognize your feeling, and then to try to change the bad feeling to a positive feeling. To do so, you can start by using this app. You can also ask yourself if the trigger is worth being upset about. You can also try applying the 12 steps to the feeling. First, admit that you are powerless to handle it alone. Then, turn the problem over to a Higher Power. That Higher Power may be a consultation with a sponsor, a therapist, or your God.<span class=\"Apple-converted-space\">  </span>Maybe take an inventory and see where your own sensitivity may be contributing to the problem. If you can determine what the character sensitivity or issue is, tell someone else. If you can't determine what it is, discuss the situation with someone else. Try to find<span class=\"Apple-converted-space\">  </span><span class=\"s1\">your </span>defect and not the defect in the person you think is causing the problem. Once you find the defect, ask God to remove it.</p>\n<p class=\"p3\"><span class=\"Apple-tab-span\">\t</span>If the problem causes resentment, pray for the person who you think is causing the resentment.<span class=\"Apple-converted-space\"> </span></p>\n<p class=\"p3\"><span class=\"Apple-tab-span\">\t</span><span class=\"Apple-converted-space\">    </span>Remember to ask God that His will be done, not yours. And most importantly, try to help someone who is new to recovery. By getting out of yourself and helping another, you may be grateful that your problem is not as bad as the other person. You may gain perspective. Your attention will be re-focused.<span class=\"Apple-converted-space\">  </span>By doing what it takes to get the bird off your head, you will avoid finding yourself saying, <b>\"If I get drunk, I won't be able to think about it.\"</b></p>\n<p class=\"p5\"><br></p>\n</body>\n</html>\n",

Always test your first thought by thinking of its consequences (good and bad) and always think of possible alternative thoughts before you act.

This just causes more conflict, stress, anger and resentment. We consequently regret acting upon our first thoughts. Acting upon our first thought is called a <i>reaction.<span class=\"Apple-converted-space\">  </span></i>In recovery, we learn to \"act upon\", not react, and this makes our lives easier.

I must combine my change of thinking with a new action whenever I begin to feel resentment. That new action may be praying for the person I resent to heal.

If you've never seen the inside of a baseball, it is tightly wound around a tiny rock hard center. You are like that baseball in that you have layer after layer of fears and resentments that are strangling your core (your true self). Your core can deal with reality; but your addiction consists of the layers of fears and resentments which make your core impotent. Once you cut through those layers by doing the 12 steps (particularly 4-7 and a daily 10<sup>th</sup>), you will free your core.<span class=\"Apple-converted-space\">  </span>And you will find that your core is this joyous being that can deal quite happily with reality without drugs.</p>\n<p class=\"p2\"><br></p>\n<p class=\"p4\">TO DO: Don't let your core strangle. Do a fourth step, a \"searching and fearless\" moral inventory to discover all your fears and resentments which are strangling your wonderful core. Then do a fifth step by admitting those fears and resentments to yourself, your Higher Power, and another trusted human being. This will free your core. And remember to do this process on a daily basis (the 10<sup>th</sup> step), so that you can keep your core free when new fears and resentments creep back into your life.</p>\n</body>\n</html>\n",

The snakes are bills, bosses, complicated financial news, health insurance issues, friends committing suicide, etc. Our bodies initial responses are to fight or flight. Both of these responses only escalate the problem, escalate the stress, and escalate the risk of relapse.</p>\n<p class=\"p2\"><span class=\"Apple-tab-span\">\t</span>When given shocking news that appears threatening, the first step to sobriety is just absorbing the blow, and not reacting. No need to immediately intellectualize a response; just absorb it until the instinct to fight or flight passes. If these instincts don't pass, call someone safe like a sponsor or friend to discuss the problem. This strategy will keep the problem from becoming trouble. Fight or flight does not work as well as compromise.</p>\n<p class=\"p2\">To Do: Imagine the shock is a snake. Most snakes are harmless. In any event, you don't need to run away or lash out at it. Just gently support your head and breathe slowly and the snake will be hypnotized. We can't do anything productive in shock. We must let it pass. Only when the instinct to fight or flee passes can we think of a rational, sober solution to a problem.

Always test your first thought by thinking of its consequences (good and bad) and always think of possible alternative thoughts before you act. Especially with addicts, our first thoughts tend to be harmful to ourselves and others. For example, usually our first thought when confronted with stress, anger or some other negative emotion is to lash out, withdraw, or escape by picking up our first drug of choice. This just causes more conflict, stress, anger and resentment. We consequently regret acting upon our first thoughts. Acting upon our first thought is called a <i>reaction.<span class=\"Apple-converted-space\">  </span></i>In recovery, we learn to \"act upon\", not react, and this makes our lives easier.

Addicts tend to be control freaks. We think we know what's right and how to do it and what everyone else should do. We want to run the show. Often with the best of intentions, we tell people what to do. The only problem is that we forget that they usually don't want to hear what we have to say- especially if we are newly sober because we have made such a mess out of our own lives that we have nothing to back up what we are saying.</p>\n<p class=\"p3\"><span class=\"Apple-tab-span\">\t</span>The twelve steps teach us that we are not in charge- that everyone (including ourselves) is much better off if we turn our control over to our Higher Power.<span class=\"Apple-converted-space\">  </span>Usually, this means that we just try to do what's in front of us without controlling people, places or things.

Learning is easier than faking knowing. Our addiction is tied to trying to look important. We drank and used because our egos wanted us to be more than what we were willing to accept. We had to put on facades, fake fronts to try to impress others. We tried to appear as if we knew it all, were totally in control, and were all powerful. But inside we knew differently so we escaped by using. The truth is that others knew we were frauds too. We ended up stressed out, full of fear, and humiliated. In recovery, we turn this humiliation into humility. We recognize that we can accept ourselves even though we are not as important as we thought we had to be. We learn to appreciate ourselves for who we are, not some egomaniacal version of who we would like to be and who we would like others to think we are. We become openminded to learning, and this actually makes us feel better.<span class=\"Apple-converted-space\"> </span></p>\n<p class=\"p2\"><br></p>\n<p class=\"p1\">To Do: Ask someone for help, and follow their suggestion. Exercising humility will bring us closer to our personal Higher Power which will keep us sober and remove our self defeating behaviors.</p>\n<p class=\"p2\"><br></p>\n<p class=\"p3\"><br></p>\n</body>\n</html>\n",

A good way to relax is to ask yourself if you really are in trouble or is it just your anxious brain talking? Addicts overanalyze. We worry about outcomes. We try to control what we cannot. We tend to think negatively. We tend to ignore good things, and dwell on bad things. Addicts use and act out to try to change their irritating brains. Unfortunately, substances and addictive behaviors not only change our brains but cause us to break laws, end up in hospitals, lose God, and ruin relationships. A better way to change our brains is to surround ourselves with recovering people who care about us, exercise, eat correctly, practice the 12 steps, and share our secrets with Sponsors.</p>\n<p class=\"p2\"><br></p>\n<p class=\"p1\">To Do: Tell yourself to stop thinking. Get out of your head and into your heart. Instead reach out to help someone or do something to serve your Higher Power. Sometimes that service can be not making a problem worse or just taking a break for a peaceful walk or some other fun activity.</p>\n<p class=\"p2\"><br></p>\n<p class=\"p3\"><br></p>\n</body>\n</html>\n",

Start by looking at your feet, squeezing your foot muscles, then slowly working your way upward. Take your time, breathing slowly. Once you have reached the top of your head, start noticing your surroundings. Then do your next daily activity, keeping your mind focused on what you are doing. Don't live in the future or the past.</p>\n<p class=\"p3\"><br></p>\n<p class=\"p4\"><br></p>\n</body>\n</html>\n",

Is that your addict voice or is that your recovery voice?<span class=\"Apple-converted-space\">  </span>Because addiction is a chronic disease, we will always have an addict voice. The key to keeping it in remission is to substitute the messages our addict voice gives us with the messages our recovery voice learns at 12 step meetings and in therapy. Your addict voice will speak to you in your style of speech in an attractive, encouraging voice. It will try to get you to use. It will try to persuade you in a way only you can understand to use \"just one\" or to not go to a meeting or to not do your morning ritual because you are too busy. It will try to tell you you're cured so you can have just one. A key to sobriety is recognizing and doing the opposite of that voice. Your addict voice causes you fear and stress. It takes a personality change to keep the addict voice quiet.</p>\n<p class=\"p2\"><br></p>\n<p class=\"p1\">To Do: Listen to the addict voice as you go through your day and substitute its advice with your recovery voice. Connect to your Higher Power and ask his help to change voices. This will keep you sober and at peace.

We have no conception of \"what we can't change\" so we force things to the point of frustration. Hard work toward goals and attempting to influence situations are wonderful only if we do not think that we have to control the outcome or that catastrophe will result if we fail. Learning how to let go and accept out situations gracefully is the miracle of walking on earth.

Not a good result huh?</p>\n<p class=\"p2\"><span class=\"Apple-tab-span\">\t</span>Now, ask yourself what step (of the 12 steps) can I apply to this issue. It might be a good idea to start with step 4 to see what character defect is causing you to struggle. Then you might need to get rid of that defect by doing steps 5-7. Usually over controlling is a problem, so step 1 applies: powerlessness over people, places, and things.</p>\n<p class=\"p3\"><br></p>\n<p class=\"p4\">To Do: Live the steps and apply each step beginning with step one to specific issues. This will reduce stress and help you make better decisions. It will also keep little things from building up, overwhelming you, frustrating you, confusing you and leading you to want to escape by using.</p>\n</body>\n</html>\n",

You probably will forget what's troubling you, but you probably won't forget if you let the symptoms of depression make you drink, eat, drug, spend hours on the internet, ruin your sleep, make you lose interest in things you used to enjoy, and otherwise ruin your day. Most times, it is the initial shock that hurts when we are confronted with an issue. Often, it is a little thing that starts us spiraling downward. It is important to not \"sweat the small stuff\". It is important to nip bad feelings in the bud.  </p>\n<p class=\"p3\">           <span class=\"Apple-converted-space\"> </span></p>\n<p class=\"p3\">           TO DO: You should use a <b>recovery tool</b> to get over the shock and forget what's bothering you, like sharing the problem with a friend, going to a meeting, journaling, deep breathing and more. Writing down something that bothers you and throwing it in the trash might help. Don't sweep your problems under the rug, deal with them one at a time. But there is a time to forget about them. Writing down 5 things you are grateful for (like being able to walk, living in a safe place, having food, etc.) may change your attitude.</p>\n<p class=\"p2\"><br></p>\n<p class=\"p4\"><br></p>\n</body>\n</html>\n",

While holding down the \"program\" button, I pressed the \"advance time\" button, but the time did not change. There was no way I was doing the procedure incorrectly. But the time would not set. Therefore, I could not program the coffee maker to have my precious coffee ready when I woke up. Another example: a troubled client sends me a threatening email on the first day of my vacation. Another example: a young couple is told that they can never have children.<span class=\"Apple-converted-space\"> </span></p>\n<p class=\"p1\"><br></p>\n<p class=\"p2\">From little issues like my coffee maker not working to life challenges like being told you can never have children, there are times when you cannot fix a problem, you can only deal with it so that it does not destroy your serenity or the manageability of your life.</p>\n<p class=\"p1\"><br></p>\n<p class=\"p3\">To Do: Practice acceptance, not judgment. Although unexpected and unfair, accept that each of us must deal with adversity. Don't feel like you must bear it alone. Ask friends and therapists for guidance and support. Create a plan to deal with adversity. Perhaps, you will have to be a bit more patient to deal with an unexpected problem. Perhaps you will have to reprioritize certain life goals to best play the new deck of cards you have been given.<span class=\"s1\"> According to As Bill Sees It, page 250,<span class=\"Apple-converted-space\">  </span>Bill W. used to lengthen his daily walks and slowly repeat the Serenity Prayer in rhythm to his steps and breathing when under acute tension.</span></p>\n<p class=\"p1\"><br></p>\n<p class=\"p4\"><br></p>\n</body>\n</html>\n",

If you've never seen the inside of a baseball, it is tightly wound around a tiny rock hard center. You are like that baseball in that you have layer after layer of fears and resentments that are strangling your core (your true self). Your core can deal with reality; but your addiction consists of the layers of fears and resentments which make your core impotent. Once you cut through those layers by doing the 12 steps (particularly 4-7 and a daily 10<sup>th</sup>), you will free your core.<span class=\"Apple-converted-space\">  </span>And you will find that your core is this joyous being that can deal quite happily with reality without drugs.</p>\n<p class=\"p2\"><br></p>\n<p class=\"p4\">TO DO: Don't let your core strangle. Do a fourth step, a \"searching and fearless\" moral inventory to discover all your fears and resentments which are strangling your wonderful core. Then do a fifth step by admitting those fears and resentments to yourself, your Higher Power, and another trusted human being. This will free your core. And remember to do this process on a daily basis (the 10<sup>th</sup> step), so that you can keep your core free when new fears and resentments creep back into your life.</p>\n</body>\n</html>\n",

Learning is easier than faking knowing. Our addiction is tied to trying to look important. We drank and used because our egos wanted us to be more than what we were willing to accept. We had to put on facades, fake fronts to try to impress others. We tried to appear as if we knew it all, were totally in control, and were all powerful. But inside we knew differently so we escaped by using. The truth is that others knew we were frauds too. We ended up stressed out, full of fear, and humiliated. In recovery, we turn this humiliation into humility. We recognize that we can accept ourselves even though we are not as important as we thought we had to be. We learn to appreciate ourselves for who we are, not some egomaniacal version of who we would like to be and who we would like others to think we are. We become openminded to learning, and this actually makes us feel better.<span class=\"Apple-converted-space\"> </span></p>\n<p class=\"p2\"><br></p>\n<p class=\"p1\">To Do: Ask someone for help, and follow their suggestion. Exercising humility will bring us closer to our personal Higher Power which will keep us sober and remove our self defeating behaviors.</p>\n<p class=\"p2\"><br></p>\n<p class=\"p3\"><br></p>\n</body>\n</html>\n",

For example, going to AA meetings instead of bars, helping others without worrying about what I was getting in return, doing my Higher Power's will and not mine.

A good way to relax is to ask yourself if you really are in trouble or is it just your anxious brain talking? Addicts overanalyze. We worry about outcomes. We try to control what we cannot. We tend to think negatively. We tend to ignore good things, and dwell on bad things. Addicts use and act out to try to change their irritating brains. Unfortunately, substances and addictive behaviors not only change our brains but cause us to break laws, end up in hospitals, lose God, and ruin relationships. A better way to change our brains is to surround ourselves with recovering people who care about us, exercise, eat correctly, practice the 12 steps, and share our secrets with Sponsors.</p>\n<p class=\"p2\"><br></p>\n<p class=\"p1\">To Do: Tell yourself to stop thinking. Get out of your head and into your heart. Instead reach out to help someone or do something to serve your Higher Power. Sometimes that service can be not making a problem worse or just taking a break for a peaceful walk or some other fun activity.</p>\n<p class=\"p2\"><br></p>\n<p class=\"p3\"><br></p>\n</body>\n</html>\n",

Start by looking at your feet, squeezing your foot muscles, then slowly working your way upward. Take your time, breathing slowly. Once you have reached the top of your head, start noticing your surroundings. Then do your next daily activity, keeping your mind focused on what you are doing. Don't live in the future or the past.</p>\n<p class=\"p3\"><br></p>\n<p class=\"p4\"><br></p>\n</body>\n</html>\n",

Is that your addict voice or is that your recovery voice?<span class=\"Apple-converted-space\">  </span>Because addiction is a chronic disease, we will always have an addict voice. The key to keeping it in remission is to substitute the messages our addict voice gives us with the messages our recovery voice learns at 12 step meetings and in therapy. Your addict voice will speak to you in your style of speech in an attractive, encouraging voice. It will try to get you to use. It will try to persuade you in a way only you can understand to use \"just one\" or to not go to a meeting or to not do your morning ritual because you are too busy. It will try to tell you you're cured so you can have just one. A key to sobriety is recognizing and doing the opposite of that voice. Your addict voice causes you fear and stress. It takes a personality change to keep the addict voice quiet.</p>\n<p class=\"p2\"><br></p>\n<p class=\"p1\">To Do: Listen to the addict voice as you go through your day and substitute its advice with your recovery voice. Connect to your Higher Power and ask his help to change voices. This will keep you sober and at peace.

We have no conception of \"what we can't change\" so we force things to the point of frustration.

It might be a good idea to start with step 4 to see what character defect is causing you to struggle. Then you might need to get rid of that defect by doing steps 5-7.

It is important to nip bad feelings in the bud.  </p>\n<p class=\"p3\">           <span class=\"Apple-converted-space\"> </span></p>\n<p class=\"p3\">           TO DO: You should use a <b>recovery tool</b> to get over the shock and forget what's bothering you, like sharing the problem with a friend, going to a meeting, journaling, deep breathing and more. Writing down something that bothers you and throwing it in the trash might help. Don't sweep your problems under the rug, deal with them one at a time. But there is a time to forget about them. Writing down 5 things you are grateful for (like being able to walk, living in a safe place, having food, etc.) may change your attitude.</p>\n<p class=\"p2\"><br></p>\n<p class=\"p4\"><br></p>\n</body>\n</html>\n",

You are like that baseball in that you have layer after layer of fears and resentments that are strangling your core (your true self). Your core can deal with reality; but your addiction consists of the layers of fears and resentments which make your core impotent. Once you cut through those layers by doing the 12 steps (particularly 4-7 and a daily 10<sup>th</sup>), you will free your core.<span class=\"Apple-converted-space\">  </span>And you will find that your core is this joyous being that can deal quite happily with reality without drugs.</p>\n<p class=\"p2\"><br></p>\n<p class=\"p4\">TO DO: Don't let your core strangle. Do a fourth step, a \"searching and fearless\" moral inventory to discover all your fears and resentments which are strangling your wonderful core. Then do a fifth step by admitting those fears and resentments to yourself, your Higher Power, and another trusted human being. This will free your core. And remember to do this process on a daily basis (the 10<sup>th</sup> step), so that you can keep your core free when new fears and resentments creep back into your life.</p>\n</body>\n</html>\n",

No matter how much you think you can control your feelings, no matter how well adjusted you think you are, no matter how well you like the 12 steps, every now and then something will happen that will upset you. The key is to not let that bird build a nest in your head. People, places, and things cannot control your emotions. They are just emotional triggers. Remember, you make yourself feel a certain way in response to the trigger. You can also quickly change how you respond.</p>\n<p class=\"p4\"><br></p>\n<p class=\"p3\"><span class=\"Apple-tab-span\">\t</span>TO DO:<span class=\"Apple-converted-space\">  </span>What's a good way to get that bird to fly away? One way is to try to recognize your feeling, and then to try to change the bad feeling to a positive feeling. To do so, you can start by using this app. You can also ask yourself if the trigger is worth being upset about. You can also try applying the 12 steps to the feeling. First, admit that you are powerless to handle it alone. Then, turn the problem over to a Higher Power. That Higher Power may be a consultation with a sponsor, a therapist, or your God.<span class=\"Apple-converted-space\">  </span>Maybe take an inventory and see where your own sensitivity may be contributing to the problem. If you can determine what the character sensitivity or issue is, tell someone else. If you can't determine what it is, discuss the situation with someone else. Try to find<span class=\"Apple-converted-space\">  </span><span class=\"s1\">your </span>defect and not the defect in the person you think is causing the problem. Once you find the defect, ask God to remove it.</p>\n<p class=\"p3\"><span class=\"Apple-tab-span\">\t</span>If the problem causes resentment, pray for the person who you think is causing the resentment.<span class=\"Apple-converted-space\"> </span></p>\n<p class=\"p3\"><span class=\"Apple-tab-span\">\t</span><span class=\"Apple-converted-space\">    </span>Remember to ask God that His will be done, not yours. And most importantly, try to help someone who is new to recovery. By getting out of yourself and helping another, you may be grateful that your problem is not as bad as the other person. You may gain perspective. Your attention will be re-focused.<span class=\"Apple-converted-space\">  </span>By doing what it takes to get the bird off your head, you will avoid finding yourself saying, <b>\"If I get drunk, I won't be able to think about it.\"</b></p>\n<p class=\"p5\"><br></p>\n</body>\n</html>\n",

This just causes more conflict, stress, anger and resentment. We consequently regret acting upon our first thoughts.

The problem with anger according to most of my patients is that \"it comes on so suddenly\". This is why daily practice to deal with anger is so critical. First, a third step prayer to start the day is essential to align one's will with God's will. This alignment removes stress induced by our small minded, egotistically imbalanced desires. Second, throughout the day, taking breaks every three hours to breathe slowly reduce the stress associated with living life like an overwhelmed juggernaut. These breathing breaks should be done before anger sets in and even on peaceful days. This proactive methodology (daily 3<sup>rd</sup> step prayer and breathing breaks) must become a habit. If anger starts, pick up the phone and share the cause with a safe person (Sponsor, friend, therapist) as soon as possible. The more anger builds, the more harm it can do to you and your relationships. Finally, as a last resort, always have an anger escape plan. For many of my patients, it's removal from the situation (\"I need to go to the restroom\", \"I need to make a call\"). If venting is necessary, a good place to do so includes yelling in one's parked car. Better to be slightly embarrassed by having to leave suddenly than to let anger dictate behavior which may be irreparable.</p>\n<p class=\"p2\"><br></p>\n<p class=\"p1\">To Do: Deal with anger proactively even if you are not angry. Share your anger with a safe person. Get anger out in safe ways.<span class=\"Apple-converted-space\"> </span></p>\n<p class=\"p2\"><br></p>\n<p class=\"p3\"><br></p>\n</body>\n</html>\n",

As I consciously told myself of reasons to be grateful for him, my anger dissipated and I actually relaxed and felt happy. <b>If you can't think of a reason to be grateful for something that the offending person did for you, focus on the fact that the person has given you the opportunity to practice good character attributes like patience and forgiveness and understanding. </b>This practice will help improve your personality and make it easier the next time someone interferes with your rights.</p>\n<p class=\"p1\">To Do: Has any family member caused you resentment or are you angry at someone? Think of something you are grateful for about that person, even if it's just that you he has given you an opportunity to grow. You are doing great by switching your attitude.

Another example: a young couple is told that they can never have children.<span class=\"Apple-converted-space\"> </span></p>\n<p class=\"p2\"><br></p>\n<p class=\"p1\">From little issues like my coffee maker not working to life challenges like being told you can never have children, there are times when you cannot fix a problem, you can only deal with it so that it does not destroy your serenity or the manageability of your life.</p>\n<p class=\"p2\"><br></p>\n<p class=\"p1\">To Do: Practice acceptance, not judgment. Although unexpected and unfair, accept that each of us must deal with adversity. Don't feel like you must bear it alone. Ask friends and therapists for guidance and support. Create a plan to deal with adversity. Perhaps, you will have to be a bit more patient to deal with an unexpected problem. Perhaps you will have to reprioritize certain life goals to best play the new deck of cards you have been given.</p>\n<p class=\"p3\"><br></p>\n</body>\n</html>\n",

No matter how much you think you can control your feelings, no matter how well adjusted you think you are, no matter how well you like the 12 steps, every now and then something will happen that will upset you. The key is to not let that bird build a nest in your head. People, places, and things cannot control your emotions. They are just emotional triggers. Remember, you make yourself feel a certain way in response to the trigger. You can also quickly change how you respond.</p>\n<p class=\"p4\"><br></p>\n<p class=\"p3\"><span class=\"Apple-tab-span\">\t</span>TO DO:<span class=\"Apple-converted-space\">  </span>What's a good way to get that bird to fly away? One way is to try to recognize your feeling, and then to try to change the bad feeling to a positive feeling. To do so, you can start by using this app. You can also ask yourself if the trigger is worth being upset about. You can also try applying the 12 steps to the feeling. First, admit that you are powerless to handle it alone. Then, turn the problem over to a Higher Power. That Higher Power may be a consultation with a sponsor, a therapist, or your God.<span class=\"Apple-converted-space\">  </span>Maybe take an inventory and see where your own sensitivity may be contributing to the problem. If you can determine what the character sensitivity or issue is, tell someone else. If you can't determine what it is, discuss the situation with someone else. Try to find<span class=\"Apple-converted-space\">  </span><span class=\"s1\">your </span>defect and not the defect in the person you think is causing the problem. Once you find the defect, ask God to remove it.</p>\n<p class=\"p3\"><span class=\"Apple-tab-span\">\t</span>If the problem causes resentment, pray for the person who you think is causing the resentment.<span class=\"Apple-converted-space\"> </span></p>\n<p class=\"p3\"><span class=\"Apple-tab-span\">\t</span><span class=\"Apple-converted-space\">    </span>Remember to ask God that His will be done, not yours. And most importantly, try to help someone who is new to recovery. By getting out of yourself and helping another, you may be grateful that your problem is not as bad as the other person. You may gain perspective. Your attention will be re-focused.<span class=\"Apple-converted-space\">  </span>By doing what it takes to get the bird off your head, you will avoid finding yourself saying, <b>\"If I get drunk, I won't be able to think about it.\"</b></p>\n<p class=\"p5\"><br></p>\n</body>\n</html>\n",

Always test your first thought by thinking of its consequences (good and bad) and always think of possible alternative thoughts before you act. Especially with addicts, our first thoughts tend to be harmful to ourselves and others. For example, usually our first thought when confronted with stress, anger or some other negative emotion is to lash out, withdraw, or escape by picking up our first drug of choice. This just causes more conflict, stress, anger and resentment. We consequently regret acting upon our first thoughts. Acting upon our first thought is called a <i>reaction.<span class=\"Apple-converted-space\">  </span></i>In recovery, we learn to \"act upon\", not react, and this makes our lives easier. When our lives are easier, we don't want to act out to avoid life so we stay sober and we make better decisions.</p>\n<p class=\"p2\"><br></p>\n<p class=\"p1\"><span class=\"Apple-tab-span\">\t</span>To Do: Move on to the second thought.

Addicts tend to be control freaks. We think we know what's right and how to do it and what everyone else should do. We want to run the show. Often with the best of intentions, we tell people what to do. The only problem is that we forget that they usually don't want to hear what we have to say- especially if we are newly sober because we have made such a mess out of our own lives that we have nothing to back up what we are saying.</p>\n<p class=\"p3\"><span class=\"Apple-tab-span\">\t</span>The twelve steps teach us that we are not in charge- that everyone (including ourselves) is much better off if we turn our control over to our Higher Power.<span class=\"Apple-converted-space\">  </span>Usually, this means that we just try to do what's in front of us without controlling people, places or things. Rather, we should just accept what is and remember everything is not about us or our way.</p>\n<p class=\"p3\"><span class=\"Apple-tab-span\">\t</span>Getting out of the way means letting go of our need to control things we cannot. This keeps us from picking up the first drink because we lose the frustration that comes with doing the impossible.

A good way to relax is to ask yourself if you really are in trouble or is it just your anxious brain talking? Addicts overanalyze. We worry about outcomes. We try to control what we cannot. We tend to think negatively. We tend to ignore good things, and dwell on bad things. Addicts use and act out to try to change their irritating brains. Unfortunately, substances and addictive behaviors not only change our brains but cause us to break laws, end up in hospitals, lose God, and ruin relationships. A better way to change our brains is to surround ourselves with recovering people who care about us, exercise, eat correctly, practice the 12 steps, and share our secrets with Sponsors.</p>\n<p class=\"p2\"><br></p>\n<p class=\"p1\">To Do: Tell yourself to stop thinking. Get out of your head and into your heart. Instead reach out to help someone or do something to serve your Higher Power. Sometimes that service can be not making a problem worse or just taking a break for a peaceful walk or some other fun activity.</p>\n<p class=\"p2\"><br></p>\n<p class=\"p3\"><br></p>\n</body>\n</html>\n",

In fact, things NEVER work out exactly as planned. So, if you are thinking life is not fair or life doesn't make sense and that this is a good reason to use, then you are not being entirely realistic. You are asking for more than what life can give you. It's OK to make plans, but you can't be God so you can't control the results. Trying to control results and people causes frustration, anger, fear, and resentment.</p>\n<p class=\"p4\"><br></p>\n<p class=\"p3\">TO DO: To feel better, have faith that your loving Higher Power has a better plan for you; it's just that you may not be able to see it yet. Remember your concept of God does not have to be a traditional, religious concept (although it can be); God can be any positive, healthy force you want that helps return you to sanity.</p>\n<p class=\"p4\"><br></p>\n<p class=\"p4\"><br></p>\n<p class=\"p4\"><br></p>\n<p class=\"p5\"><br></p>\n</body>\n</html>\n",

Sobriety requires us to focus less about ourselves and our rights. Sobriety asks us to just deal positively with the experience. When we simply live the experience without making it all about me, we avoid \"pity parties\" or \"egocentric grandiosity\" which used to lead us to use. Once we rebalance our ego, we will lose fear, anger and resentment because we won't be so obsessed with what happened, what is happening, or what will be happening to the almighty ME.

You probably will forget what's troubling you, but you probably won't forget if you let the symptoms of depression make you drink, eat, drug, spend hours on the internet, ruin your sleep, make you lose interest in things you used to enjoy, and otherwise ruin your day. Most times, it is the initial shock that hurts when we are confronted with an issue. Often, it is a little thing that starts us spiraling downward. It is important to not \"sweat the small stuff\". It is important to nip bad feelings in the bud.  </p>\n<p class=\"p3\">           <span class=\"Apple-converted-space\"> </span></p>\n<p class=\"p3\">           TO DO: You should use a <b>recovery tool</b> to get over the shock and forget what's bothering you, like sharing the problem with a friend, going to a meeting, journaling, deep breathing and more. Writing down something that bothers you and throwing it in the trash might help. Don't sweep your problems under the rug, deal with them one at a time. But there is a time to forget about them. Writing down 5 things you are grateful for (like being able to walk, living in a safe place, having food, etc.) may change your attitude.</p>\n<p class=\"p2\"><br></p>\n<p class=\"p4\"><br></p>\n</body>\n</html>\n",

That fall is to hospitals, jail, or death.</p>\n<p class=\"p2\"><br></p>\n<p class=\"p1\">To Do: Don't use money as an excuse to use. Don't let money interfere with humbly working the 12 steps.</p>\n<p class=\"p3\"><br></p>\n</body>\n</html>\n",

Don't let that confusion make you use. Remember, no one has all the answers. And anyone, who thinks he does, is misleading himself. If you are unsure of whether or not you are an addict, don't automatically deny that you are. Rather, give treatment a chance and see if your life is easier (with less bad consequences) when you are not using. If you are confused about whether or not you can have a Higher Power, remember that you don't have to have a perfect idea of one. Many addicts use the group as a Higher Power. Ask yourself whether or not your drug of choice had become a harmful Higher Power and whether or not it's time to pick a healing Higher Power. If you think you know how to stay sober on your own, you probably have a lot to learn, particularly if you have tried to stop using on your own before. So get to treatment and a meeting. If you think you are going to make the perfect decision with results that will work out exactly as planned, you have a lot to learn.<span class=\"Apple-converted-space\"> </span></p>\n<p class=\"p2\"><br></p>\n<p class=\"p1\">To Do: It's time to let go of knowing everything.

Don't punt the ball and give it to your evil Higher Power: booze, drugs, fatty food, cigarettes, harmful sex objects, etc. Just because you have failed a little by not going to meetings or seeing your therapist or doing your daily treatment regimen does not mean that you have to fail all the way.<span class=\"Apple-converted-space\">  </span>You do not have to take the next step and relapse.

You are like that baseball in that you have layer after layer of fears and resentments that are strangling your core (your true self). Your core can deal with reality; but your addiction consists of the layers of fears and resentments which make your core impotent.

Do a fourth step, a \"searching and fearless\" moral inventory to discover all your fears and resentments which are strangling your wonderful core. Then do a fifth step by admitting those fears and resentments to yourself, your Higher Power, and another trusted human being. This will free your core. And remember to do this process on a daily basis (the 10<sup>th</sup> step), so that you can keep your core free when new fears and resentments creep back into your life.</p>\n</body>\n</html>\n",

For example, see if changing how you deal with resentment helps you.<span class=\"Apple-converted-space\">  </span>If I am resentful, I must think about resentment in a different way. Instead of bathing in it and feeling worse and worse, I must think about getting out of that bath and substituting resentment with empathy. But this change of thinking is only the beginning. I must combine my change of thinking with a new action whenever I begin to feel resentment. That new action may be praying for the person I resent to heal. It may be doing something else positive for my life so that I don't think about the resentment. It may be forgiving the person.</p>\n<p class=\"p2\"><br></p>\n<p class=\"p1\">To Do: To stay sober, we must change our thoughts and actions so that the feelings which used to drive us to use can't control us.

That fall is to hospitals, jail, or death.</p>\n<p class=\"p2\"><br></p>\n<p class=\"p1\">To Do: Don't use money as an excuse to use. Don't let money interfere with humbly working the 12 steps.</p>\n<p class=\"p3\"><br></p>\n</body>\n</html>\n",

It starts with a decrease in 12 step meeting attendance, a decrease in contacting one's sponsor, and a decrease in living the 12 steps. Usually this decrease in daily recovery technique implementation occurs because the relapser believes he or she is cured. Therefore, something becomes more important than implementing a strong daily program. Without such a program, life's frustrations and temptations cannot be managed. Gradually, the relapser will be exposed to high risk situations which will allow him or her access to alcohol or drugs.<span class=\"Apple-converted-space\">  </span>Finally, the relapser will fantasize about the \"good things\" of using, groom for the use of the drug, and act out completing the relapse.</p>\n<p class=\"p3\"><br></p>\n<p class=\"p1\">TO DO: Ask yourself if something has greater priority for you than staying sober?

If you've never seen the inside of a baseball, it is tightly wound around a tiny rock hard center. You are like that baseball in that you have layer after layer of fears and resentments that are strangling your core (your true self). Your core can deal with reality; but your addiction consists of the layers of fears and resentments which make your core impotent. Once you cut through those layers by doing the 12 steps (particularly 4-7 and a daily 10<sup>th</sup>), you will free your core.<span class=\"Apple-converted-space\">  </span>And you will find that your core is this joyous being that can deal quite happily with reality without drugs.</p>\n<p class=\"p2\"><br></p>\n<p class=\"p4\">TO DO: Don't let your core strangle. Do a fourth step, a \"searching and fearless\" moral inventory to discover all your fears and resentments which are strangling your wonderful core. Then do a fifth step by admitting those fears and resentments to yourself, your Higher Power, and another trusted human being. This will free your core. And remember to do this process on a daily basis (the 10<sup>th</sup> step), so that you can keep your core free when new fears and resentments creep back into your life.</p>\n</body>\n</html>\n",

No matter how much you think you can control your feelings, no matter how well adjusted you think you are, no matter how well you like the 12 steps, every now and then something will happen that will upset you. The key is to not let that bird build a nest in your head. People, places, and things cannot control your emotions. They are just emotional triggers. Remember, you make yourself feel a certain way in response to the trigger. You can also quickly change how you respond.</p>\n<p class=\"p4\"><br></p>\n<p class=\"p3\"><span class=\"Apple-tab-span\">\t</span>TO DO:<span class=\"Apple-converted-space\">  </span>What's a good way to get that bird to fly away? One way is to try to recognize your feeling, and then to try to change the bad feeling to a positive feeling. To do so, you can start by using this app. You can also ask yourself if the trigger is worth being upset about. You can also try applying the 12 steps to the feeling. First, admit that you are powerless to handle it alone. Then, turn the problem over to a Higher Power. That Higher Power may be a consultation with a sponsor, a therapist, or your God.<span class=\"Apple-converted-space\">  </span>Maybe take an inventory and see where your own sensitivity may be contributing to the problem. If you can determine what the character sensitivity or issue is, tell someone else. If you can't determine what it is, discuss the situation with someone else. Try to find<span class=\"Apple-converted-space\">  </span><span class=\"s1\">your </span>defect and not the defect in the person you think is causing the problem. Once you find the defect, ask God to remove it.</p>\n<p class=\"p3\"><span class=\"Apple-tab-span\">\t</span>If the problem causes resentment, pray for the person who you think is causing the resentment.<span class=\"Apple-converted-space\"> </span></p>\n<p class=\"p3\"><span class=\"Apple-tab-span\">\t</span><span class=\"Apple-converted-space\">    </span>Remember to ask God that His will be done, not yours. And most importantly, try to help someone who is new to recovery. By getting out of yourself and helping another, you may be grateful that your problem is not as bad as the other person. You may gain perspective. Your attention will be re-focused.<span class=\"Apple-converted-space\">  </span>By doing what it takes to get the bird off your head, you will avoid finding yourself saying, <b>\"If I get drunk, I won't be able to think about it.\"</b></p>\n<p class=\"p5\"><br></p>\n</body>\n</html>\n",

Always test your first thought by thinking of its consequences (good and bad) and always think of possible alternative thoughts before you act.

For example, usually our first thought when confronted with stress, anger or some other negative emotion is to lash out, withdraw, or escape by picking up our first drug of choice. This just causes more conflict, stress, anger and resentment. We consequently regret acting upon our first thoughts. Acting upon our first thought is called a <i>reaction.<span class=\"Apple-converted-space\">  </span></i>In recovery, we learn to \"act upon\", not react, and this makes our lives easier.

Addicts tend to be control freaks. We think we know what's right and how to do it and what everyone else should do. We want to run the show. Often with the best of intentions, we tell people what to do. The only problem is that we forget that they usually don't want to hear what we have to say- especially if we are newly sober because we have made such a mess out of our own lives that we have nothing to back up what we are saying.</p>\n<p class=\"p3\"><span class=\"Apple-tab-span\">\t</span>The twelve steps teach us that we are not in charge- that everyone (including ourselves) is much better off if we turn our control over to our Higher Power.<span class=\"Apple-converted-space\">  </span>Usually, this means that we just try to do what's in front of us without controlling people, places or things.

Unfortunately, substances and addictive behaviors not only change our brains but cause us to break laws, end up in hospitals, lose God, and ruin relationships. A better way to change our brains is to surround ourselves with recovering people who care about us, exercise, eat correctly, practice the 12 steps, and share our secrets with Sponsors.</p>\n<p class=\"p2\"><br></p>\n<p class=\"p1\">To Do: Tell yourself to stop thinking. Get out of your head and into your heart. Instead reach out to help someone or do something to serve your Higher Power. Sometimes that service can be not making a problem worse or just taking a break for a peaceful walk or some other fun activity.</p>\n<p class=\"p2\"><br></p>\n<p class=\"p3\"><br></p>\n</body>\n</html>\n",

Start by looking at your feet, squeezing your foot muscles, then slowly working your way upward. Take your time, breathing slowly. Once you have reached the top of your head, start noticing your surroundings. Then do your next daily activity, keeping your mind focused on what you are doing. Don't live in the future or the past.</p>\n<p class=\"p3\"><br></p>\n<p class=\"p4\"><br></p>\n</body>\n</html>\n",

Since you can't, should you let what's bothering you today make you drink or use?\"</p>\n<p class=\"p2\"><br></p>\n<p class=\"p3\">Is what's bothering you interfering with your life? You probably will forget what's troubling you, but you probably won't forget if you let the symptoms of depression make you drink, eat, drug, spend hours on the internet, ruin your sleep, make you lose interest in things you used to enjoy, and otherwise ruin your day. Most times, it is the initial shock that hurts when we are confronted with an issue. Often, it is a little thing that starts us spiraling downward. It is important to not \"sweat the small stuff\". It is important to nip bad feelings in the bud.  </p>\n<p class=\"p3\">           <span class=\"Apple-converted-space\"> </span></p>\n<p class=\"p3\">           TO DO: You should use a <b>recovery tool</b> to get over the shock and forget what's bothering you, like sharing the problem with a friend, going to a meeting, journaling, deep breathing and more. Writing down something that bothers you and throwing it in the trash might help. Don't sweep your problems under the rug, deal with them one at a time. But there is a time to forget about them. Writing down 5 things you are grateful for (like being able to walk, living in a safe place, having food, etc.) may change your attitude.</p>\n<p class=\"p2\"><br></p>\n<p class=\"p4\"><br></p>\n</body>\n</html>\n",

Is that your addict voice or is that your recovery voice?<span class=\"Apple-converted-space\">  </span>Because addiction is a chronic disease, we will always have an addict voice. The key to keeping it in remission is to substitute the messages our addict voice gives us with the messages our recovery voice learns at 12 step meetings and in therapy. Your addict voice will speak to you in your style of speech in an attractive, encouraging voice. It will try to get you to use. It will try to persuade you in a way only you can understand to use \"just one\" or to not go to a meeting or to not do your morning ritual because you are too busy. It will try to tell you you're cured so you can have just one. A key to sobriety is recognizing and doing the opposite of that voice. Your addict voice causes you fear and stress. It takes a personality change to keep the addict voice quiet.</p>\n<p class=\"p2\"><br></p>\n<p class=\"p1\">To Do: Listen to the addict voice as you go through your day and substitute its advice with your recovery voice. Connect to your Higher Power and ask his help to change voices. This will keep you sober and at peace. Good for you for using this App to change voices!</p>\n<p class=\"p3\"><br></p>\n</body>\n</html>\n",

Every time we used, we wanted the same effect (escape), but they worked less effectively each time until they just made the pain immediately worse.

No need to immediately intellectualize a response; just absorb it until the instinct to fight or flight passes.

Fight or flight does not work as well as compromise.</p>\n<p class=\"p2\">To Do: Imagine the shock is a snake. Most snakes are harmless. In any event, you don't need to run away or lash out at it. Just gently support your head and breathe slowly and the snake will be hypnotized. We can't do anything productive in shock. We must let it pass. Only when the instinct to fight or flee passes can we think of a rational, sober solution to a problem.</p>\n<p class=\"p3\"><br></p>\n</body>\n</html>\n",

Addicts tend to be control freaks. We think we know what's right and how to do it and what everyone else should do. We want to run the show. Often with the best of intentions, we tell people what to do. The only problem is that we forget that they usually don't want to hear what we have to say- especially if we are newly sober because we have made such a mess out of our own lives that we have nothing to back up what we are saying.</p>\n<p class=\"p3\"><span class=\"Apple-tab-span\">\t</span>The twelve steps teach us that we are not in charge- that everyone (including ourselves) is much better off if we turn our control over to our Higher Power.<span class=\"Apple-converted-space\">  </span>Usually, this means that we just try to do what's in front of us without controlling people, places or things. Rather, we should just accept what is and remember everything is not about us or our way.</p>\n<p class=\"p3\"><span class=\"Apple-tab-span\">\t</span>Getting out of the way means letting go of our need to control things we cannot. This keeps us from picking up the first drink because we lose the frustration that comes with doing the impossible.

A good way to relax is to ask yourself if you really are in trouble or is it just your anxious brain talking? Addicts overanalyze. We worry about outcomes. We try to control what we cannot. We tend to think negatively. We tend to ignore good things, and dwell on bad things. Addicts use and act out to try to change their irritating brains. Unfortunately, substances and addictive behaviors not only change our brains but cause us to break laws, end up in hospitals, lose God, and ruin relationships. A better way to change our brains is to surround ourselves with recovering people who care about us, exercise, eat correctly, practice the 12 steps, and share our secrets with Sponsors.</p>\n<p class=\"p2\"><br></p>\n<p class=\"p1\">To Do: Tell yourself to stop thinking. Get out of your head and into your heart. Instead reach out to help someone or do something to serve your Higher Power. Sometimes that service can be not making a problem worse or just taking a break for a peaceful walk or some other fun activity.</p>\n<p class=\"p2\"><br></p>\n<p class=\"p3\"><br></p>\n</body>\n</html>\n",

Don't let that frustration make you use. Remember, no one has all the answers. And anyone, who thinks he does, is misleading himself.

Rather, give treatment a chance and see if your life is easier (with less bad consequences) when you are not using. If you are confused about whether or not you can have a Higher Power, remember that you don't have to have a perfect idea of one. Many addicts use the group as a Higher Power. Ask yourself whether or not your drug of choice had become a harmful Higher Power and whether or not it's time to pick a healing Higher Power. If you think you know how to stay sober on your own, you probably have a lot to learn, particularly if you have tried to stop using on your own before. So get to treatment and a meeting. If you think you are going to make the perfect decision with results that will work out exactly as planned, you have a lot to learn.<span class=\"Apple-converted-space\"> </span></p>\n<p class=\"p2\"><br></p>\n<p class=\"p1\">To Do: It's time to let go of knowing everything.

In fact, things NEVER work out exactly as planned. So, if you are thinking life is not fair or life doesn't make sense and that this is a good reason to use, then you are not being entirely realistic. You are asking for more than what life can give you. It's OK to make plans, but you can't be God so you can't control the results.

Acting upon our first thought is called a <i>reaction.<span class=\"Apple-converted-space\">  </span></i>In recovery, we learn to \"act upon\", not react, and this makes our lives easier.

It will try to tell you you're cured so you can have just one. A key to sobriety is recognizing and doing the opposite of that voice. Your addict voice causes you fear and stress. It takes a personality change to keep the addict voice quiet.</p>\n<p class=\"p2\"><br></p>\n<p class=\"p1\">To Do: Listen to the addict voice as you go through your day and substitute its advice with your recovery voice. Connect to your Higher Power and ask his help to change voices. This will keep you sober and at peace. Good for you for using this App to change voices!</p>\n<p class=\"p3\"><br></p>\n</body>\n</html>\n",

Picking up the first one relieves nothing. It just creates more craving. The only way to get rid of the craving is to not pick up, and the only way to not pick up is to think through picking up the first one to its bitter end. Then using a recovery tool like calling someone and talking about your craving.</p>\n<p class=\"p1\">To Do: Using doesn't relieve cravings so pick up a recovery tool (like calling someone, prayer, finding and going to a meeting, helping someone else) instead of picking up the drug or process you are craving. You don't have to use just because you crave. When you don't act out,<span class=\"Apple-converted-space\">  </span>you will feel happier than you think you would have if you had acted out.</p>\n<p class=\"p2\"><br></p>\n</body>\n</html>\n",

No matter how much you think you can control your feelings, no matter how well adjusted you think you are, no matter how well you like the 12 steps, every now and then something will happen that will upset you. The key is to not let that bird build a nest in your head. People, places, and things cannot control your emotions. They are just emotional triggers. Remember, you make yourself feel a certain way in response to the trigger. You can also quickly change how you respond. It's the bird that is causing you to want to use.</p>\n<p class=\"p4\"><br></p>\n<p class=\"p3\"><span class=\"Apple-tab-span\">\t</span>TO DO:<span class=\"Apple-converted-space\">  </span>What's a good way to get that bird to fly away? First, using will only feed the bird and help him build his nest in your head. The bird will fly away if you try to recognize your feeling, and then try to change the bad feeling to a positive feeling. To do so, you can start by using this app. You can also ask yourself if the trigger is worth being upset about. You can also try applying the 12 steps to the feeling. First, admit that you are powerless to handle it alone. Then, turn the problem over to a Higher Power. That Higher Power may be a consultation with a sponsor, a therapist, or your God.<span class=\"Apple-converted-space\">  </span>Maybe take an inventory and see where your own sensitivity may be contributing to the problem. If you can determine what the character sensitivity or issue is, tell someone else. If you can't determine what it is, discuss the situation with someone else. Try to find<span class=\"Apple-converted-space\">  </span><span class=\"s1\">your </span>defect and not the defect in the person you think is causing the problem. Once you find the defect, ask God to remove it.</p>\n<p class=\"p3\"><span class=\"Apple-tab-span\">\t</span>If the problem causes resentment, pray for the person who you think is causing the resentment. Substitute resentment with empathy.</p>\n<p class=\"p3\"><span class=\"Apple-tab-span\">\t</span><span class=\"Apple-converted-space\">    </span>Remember to ask God that His will be done, not yours. And most importantly, try to help someone who is new to recovery. By getting out of yourself and helping another, you may be grateful that your problem is not as bad as the other person. You may gain perspective. Your attention will be re-focused.<span class=\"Apple-converted-space\">  </span>By doing what it takes to get the bird off your head, you will avoid finding yourself saying, <b>\"If I get drunk, I won't be able to think about it.\"</b></p>\n<p class=\"p5\"><br></p>\n</body>\n</html>\n",

Honesty is admitting that your excuse to use your drug is insane.</p>\n<p class=\"p3\"><span class=\"Apple-tab-span\">\t</span>\"O\" stands for open-mindedness. Open-mindedness means discarding what <span class=\"s1\">you</span> think will keep you sober and following what <span class=\"s1\">someone else</span> says will keep you sober.</p>\n<p class=\"p3\"><span class=\"Apple-tab-span\">\t</span>\"W\" stands for willingness. You must be <span class=\"s1\">absolutely </span>desirous to stay sober.</p>\n<p class=\"p3\"><span class=\"Apple-tab-span\">\t</span>That is HOW you begin to not pick up the first drink.</p>\n<p class=\"p2\"><br></p>\n<p class=\"p3\">TO DO: Recalling your past \"use\" history, ask yourself if you are being <span class=\"s1\">honest </span>with yourself if you think you can safely pick up a drink, drug or other addictive behavior. If you answer no or maybe, become open to help and call someone in recovery and <span class=\"s1\">do </span>what that person says.<span class=\"Apple-converted-space\"> </span></p>\n<p class=\"p2\"><br></p>\n<p class=\"p4\"><br></p>\n</body>\n</html>\n",

Start by looking at your feet, squeezing your foot muscles, then slowly working your way upward. Take your time, breathing slowly. Once you have reached the top of your head, start noticing your surroundings. Then do your next daily activity, keeping your mind focused on what you are doing. Don't live in the future or the past. Whatever you do, don't use. Call or text someone now.</p>\n<p class=\"p3\"><br></p>\n<p class=\"p4\"><br></p>\n</body>\n</html>\n",

Is that your addict voice or is that your recovery voice?<span class=\"Apple-converted-space\">  </span>Because addiction is a chronic disease, we will always have an addict voice. The key to keeping it in remission is to substitute the messages our addict voice gives us with the messages our recovery voice learns at 12 step meetings and in therapy. Your addict voice will speak to you in your style of speech in an attractive, encouraging voice. It will try to get you to use. It will try to persuade you in a way only you can understand to use \"just one\" or to not go to a meeting or to not do your morning ritual because you are too busy. It will try to tell you you're cured so you can have just one. A key to sobriety is recognizing and doing the opposite of that voice. Your addict voice causes you fear and stress. It takes a personality change to keep the addict voice quiet.</p>\n<p class=\"p2\"><br></p>\n<p class=\"p1\">To Do: Listen to the addict voice as you go through your day and substitute its advice with your recovery voice. Connect to your Higher Power and ask his help to change voices. This will keep you sober and at peace. Good for you for using this App to change voices!</p>\n<p class=\"p3\"><br></p>\n</body>\n</html>\n",

It is important to nip bad feelings in the bud.  </p>\n<p class=\"p3\">           <span class=\"Apple-converted-space\"> </span></p>\n<p class=\"p3\">           TO DO: You should use a <b>recovery tool</b> to get over the shock and forget what's bothering you, like sharing the problem with a friend, going to a meeting, journaling, deep breathing and more. Writing down something that bothers you and throwing it in the trash might help. Don't sweep your problems under the rug, deal with them one at a time. But there is a time to forget about them. Writing down 5 things you are grateful for (like being able to walk, living in a safe place, having food, etc.) may change your attitude.</p>\n<p class=\"p2\"><br></p>\n<p class=\"p4\"><br></p>\n</body>\n</html>\n",

That ego tells us we are no good if we make mistakes so we try to convince everyone, including ourselves, that we were right.

Ask friends and therapists for guidance and support. Create a plan to deal with adversity. Perhaps, you will have to be a bit more patient to deal with an unexpected problem.

This in turn will change how you feel. If I am resentful, I must think about resentment in a different way. Instead of bathing in it and feeling worse and worse, I must think about getting out of that bath and substituting resentment with empathy. But this change of thinking is only the beginning. I must combine my change of thinking with a new action whenever I begin to feel resentment. That new action may be praying for the person I resent to heal. It may be doing something else positive for my life so that I don't think about the resentment. It may be forgiving the person.</p>\n<p class=\"p2\"><br></p>\n<p class=\"p1\">To Do: To stay sober, we must change our thoughts and actions so that the feelings which used to drive us to use can't control us.

If you start using, you start a perilous, physiological and psychological chain reaction. Since your body has already become habituated to your drug of choice, any drug ingestion triggers your craving for the feeling that your drug of choice gave you. This ironically causes craving for more rather than relief. Finally, trouble occurs due to intoxication.</p>\n<p class=\"p2\"><br></p>\n<p class=\"p1\">To Do: Stop fantasizing about the good times when using and remember the Hell of using.

It is up to you (with the help of your counselor, sponsor, 12 step friends) to discover your triggers.</p>\n<p class=\"p2\"><br></p>\n<p class=\"p3\">TO DO: Think about what happened before you last used instead of fantasizing about how using will help. Take your time and try to remember what events proceeded your typical using.

Minimizations include \"I wasn't that bad\" or \"I only use every now and then\". Blindness means that you think \"drugs are the solution to your problems\".

Think back to when you began using. We used drugs because they worked the first time we tried them. They may have made us sick, but they did something much more important. They made us not care about not getting our way. They took away the fear, anger, and resentment. Every time we used, we wanted the same effect (escape), but they worked less effectively each time until they just made the pain immediately worse. But by then we needed help to stop because our bodies had become psychologically and physically dependent. Drugs had allowed us fly to nowhere but then they made nowhere Hell.</p>\n<p class=\"p2\"><br></p>\n<p class=\"p1\">TO DO: Follow the urge to use through to its bitter end by remembering where that first drink or drug ultimately took you.</p>\n<p class=\"p3\"><br></p>\n</body>\n</html>\n",

Always test your first thought by thinking of its consequences (good and bad) and always think of possible alternative thoughts before you act. Especially with addicts, our first thoughts tend to be harmful to ourselves and others. For example, usually our first thought when confronted with stress, anger or some other negative emotion is to lash out, withdraw, or escape by picking up our first drug of choice. This just causes more conflict, stress, anger and resentment. We consequently regret acting upon our first thoughts. Acting upon our first thought is called a <i>reaction.<span class=\"Apple-converted-space\">  </span></i>In recovery, we learn to \"act upon\", not react, and this makes our lives easier.

Exercise mindfulness. Mindfulness means that you are slowly breathing and keeping your mind in the moment. Start by looking at your feet, squeezing your foot muscles, then slowly working your way upward. Take your time, breathing slowly. Once you have reached the top of your head, start noticing your surroundings. Then do your next daily activity, keeping your mind focused on what you are doing. Don't live in the future or the past.</p>\n<p class=\"p3\"><br></p>\n<p class=\"p4\"><br></p>\n</body>\n</html>\n",

Is that your addict voice or is that your recovery voice?<span class=\"Apple-converted-space\">  </span>Because addiction is a chronic disease, we will always have an addict voice. The key to keeping it in remission is to substitute the messages our addict voice gives us with the messages our recovery voice learns at 12 step meetings and in therapy. Your addict voice will speak to you in your style of speech in an attractive, encouraging voice. It will try to get you to use. It will try to persuade you in a way only you can understand to use \"just one\" or to not go to a meeting or to not do your morning ritual because you are too busy. It will try to tell you you're cured so you can have just one. A key to sobriety is recognizing and doing the opposite of that voice. Your addict voice causes you fear and stress. It takes a personality change to keep the addict voice quiet.</p>\n<p class=\"p2\"><br></p>\n<p class=\"p1\">To Do: Listen to the addict voice as you go through your day and substitute its advice with your recovery voice. Connect to your Higher Power and ask his help to change voices. This will keep you sober and at peace. Good for you for using this App to change voices!</p>\n<p class=\"p3\"><br></p>\n</body>\n</html>\n",

It's that first one that is the engine and that engine is what runs you down, not the caboose.</p>\n<p class=\"p3\"><span class=\"Apple-tab-span\">\t</span>Again, the addict, the thinking person that he is, wants to complicate this theory. He wants to think he can retrain his brain to use safely. He thinks he can control anything so he thinks he can exercise the same discipline to successfully use.<span class=\"Apple-converted-space\"> </span></p>\n<p class=\"p3\"><span class=\"Apple-tab-span\">\t</span>All these traits only lead to disaster because addiction is a disease. It is beyond will power.<span class=\"Apple-converted-space\"> </span></p>\n<p class=\"p4\"><br></p>\n<p class=\"p3\">TO DO: Do not pick up the first one. Call someone and share about your craving. Only by not giving in to your craving will the craving go away. If you give in to it, you will crave more.</p>\n<p class=\"p5\"><br></p>\n</body>\n</html>\n",

Is that your addict voice or is that your recovery voice?<span class=\"Apple-converted-space\">  </span>Because addiction is a chronic disease, we will always have an addict voice. The key to keeping it in remission is to substitute the messages our addict voice gives us with the messages our recovery voice learns at 12 step meetings and in therapy. Your addict voice will speak to you in your style of speech in an attractive, encouraging voice. It will try to get you to use. It will try to persuade you in a way only you can understand to use \"just one\" or to not go to a meeting or to not do your morning ritual because you are too busy. It will try to tell you you're cured so you can have just one. A key to sobriety is recognizing and doing the opposite of that voice. Your addict voice causes you fear and stress. It takes a personality change to keep the addict voice quiet.</p>\n<p class=\"p2\"><br></p>\n<p class=\"p1\">To Do: Listen to the addict voice as you go through your day and substitute its advice with your recovery voice. Connect to your Higher Power and ask his help to change voices. This will keep you sober and at peace. Good for you for using this App to change voices!</p>\n<p class=\"p3\"><br></p>\n</body>\n</html>\n",

It starts with a decrease in 12 step meeting attendance, a decrease in contacting one's sponsor, and a decrease in living the 12 steps. Usually this decrease in daily recovery technique implementation occurs because the relapser believes he or she is cured. Therefore, something becomes more important than implementing a strong daily program. Without such a program, life's frustrations and temptations cannot be managed. Gradually, the relapser will be exposed to high risk situations which will allow him or her access to alcohol or drugs.<span class=\"Apple-converted-space\">  </span>Finally, the relapser will fantasize about the \"good things\" of using, groom for the use of the drug, and act out completing the relapse.</p>\n<p class=\"p3\"><br></p>\n<p class=\"p1\">TO DO: Ask yourself if something has greater priority for you than staying sober?

If I am trying to control my use, I am already out of control. Social users do not deal with the issue of control. They just stop. I used to tell myself that if I just had a better TV with a clearer picture, I wouldn't drink excessively. I reasoned that the frustration caused by the TV was making me drink uncontrollably. This is an example of rationalization or a \"self lie.\" The truth is that any frustration had become a trigger for my drinking. The truth is that my drinking had reached a point where it was such a part of my personality that I had to change my personality to stop drinking. Whether or not I had a better TV made no difference. If I picked up the first drink, the progression could not be controlled.</p>\n<p class=\"p4\"><br></p>\n<p class=\"p3\">TO DO: If you doubt you are an addict, get a professional assessment. Also, ask yourself if you are blaming something or someone for your uncontrollable drug use or \"stinking thinking?\" We need to change ourselves today, not other people or things.</p>\n<p class=\"p5\"><br></p>\n</body>\n</html>\n",

Minimizations include \"I wasn't that bad\" or \"I only use every now and then\". Blindness means that you think \"drugs are the solution to your problems\".

Always test your first thought by thinking of its consequences (good and bad) and always think of possible alternative thoughts before you act.

For example, usually our first thought when confronted with stress, anger or some other negative emotion is to lash out, withdraw, or escape by picking up our first drug of choice. This just causes more conflict, stress, anger and resentment. We consequently regret acting upon our first thoughts. Acting upon our first thought is called a <i>reaction.<span class=\"Apple-converted-space\">  </span></i>In recovery, we learn to \"act upon\", not react, and this makes our lives easier.

If you think you know how to stay sober on your own, you probably have a lot to learn, particularly if you have tried to stop using on your own before. So get to treatment and a meeting.

Always test your first thought by thinking of its consequences (good and bad) and always think of possible alternative thoughts before you act. Especially with addicts, our first thoughts tend to be harmful to ourselves and others. For example, usually our first thought when confronted with stress, anger or some other negative emotion is to lash out, withdraw, or escape by picking up our first drug of choice. This just causes more conflict, stress, anger and resentment. We consequently regret acting upon our first thoughts. Acting upon our first thought is called a <i>reaction.<span class=\"Apple-converted-space\">  </span></i>In recovery, we learn to \"act upon\", not react, and this makes our lives easier. When our lives are easier, we don't want to act out to avoid life so we stay sober and we make better decisions.</p>\n<p class=\"p2\"><br></p>\n<p class=\"p1\"><span class=\"Apple-tab-span\">\t</span>To Do: Move on to the second thought.

We try to control what we cannot. We tend to think negatively. We tend to ignore good things, and dwell on bad things. Addicts use and act out to try to change their irritating brains. Unfortunately, substances and addictive behaviors not only change our brains but cause us to break laws, end up in hospitals, lose God, and ruin relationships. A better way to change our brains is to surround ourselves with recovering people who care about us, exercise, eat correctly, practice the 12 steps, and share our secrets with Sponsors.</p>\n<p class=\"p2\"><br></p>\n<p class=\"p1\">To Do: Tell yourself to stop thinking. Get out of your head and into your heart. Instead reach out to help someone or do something to serve your Higher Power. Sometimes that service can be not making a problem worse or just taking a break for a peaceful walk or some other fun activity.</p>\n<p class=\"p2\"><br></p>\n<p class=\"p3\"><br></p>\n</body>\n</html>\n",

You probably will forget what's troubling you, but you probably won't forget if you let the symptoms of depression make you drink, eat, drug, spend hours on the internet, ruin your sleep, make you lose interest in things you used to enjoy, and otherwise ruin your day. Most times, it is the initial shock that hurts when we are confronted with an issue. Often, it is a little thing that starts us spiraling downward. It is important to not \"sweat the small stuff\". It is important to nip bad feelings in the bud.  </p>\n<p class=\"p3\">           <span class=\"Apple-converted-space\"> </span></p>\n<p class=\"p3\">           TO DO: You should use a <b>recovery tool</b> to get over the shock and forget what's bothering you, like sharing the problem with a friend, going to a meeting, journaling, deep breathing and more. Writing down something that bothers you and throwing it in the trash might help. Don't sweep your problems under the rug, deal with them one at a time. But there is a time to forget about them. Writing down 5 things you are grateful for (like being able to walk, living in a safe place, having food, etc.) may change your attitude.</p>\n<p class=\"p2\"><br></p>\n<p class=\"p4\"><br></p>\n</body>\n</html>\n",

You probably will forget what's troubling you, but you probably won't forget if you let the symptoms of depression make you drink, eat, drug, spend hours on the internet, ruin your sleep, make you lose interest in things you used to enjoy, and otherwise ruin your day. Most times, it is the initial shock that hurts when we are confronted with an issue. Often, it is a little thing that starts us spiraling downward. It is important to not \"sweat the small stuff\". It is important to nip bad feelings in the bud.  </p>\n<p class=\"p3\">           <span class=\"Apple-converted-space\"> </span></p>\n<p class=\"p3\">           TO DO: You should use a <b>recovery tool</b> to get over the shock and forget what's bothering you, like sharing the problem with a friend, going to a meeting, journaling, deep breathing and more. Writing down something that bothers you and throwing it in the trash might help. Don't sweep your problems under the rug, deal with them one at a time. But there is a time to forget about them. Writing down 5 things you are grateful for (like being able to walk, living in a safe place, having food, etc.) may change your attitude.</p>\n<p class=\"p2\"><br></p>\n<p class=\"p4\"><br></p>\n</body>\n</html>\n",

If you've never seen the inside of a baseball, it is tightly wound around a tiny rock hard center. You are like that baseball in that you have layer after layer of fears and resentments that are strangling your core (your true self). Your core can deal with reality; but your addiction consists of the layers of anger,<span class=\"Apple-converted-space\">  </span>fears and resentments which make your core impotent. Once you cut through those layers by doing the 12 steps (particularly 4-7 and a daily 10<sup>th</sup>), you will free your core.<span class=\"Apple-converted-space\">  </span>And you will find that your core is this joyous being that can deal quite happily with reality without drugs.</p>\n<p class=\"p2\"><br></p>\n<p class=\"p4\">TO DO: Don't let your core strangle with anger. Do a fourth step, a \"searching and fearless\" moral inventory to discover why your anger is strangling your wonderful core. Then do a fifth step by admitting anger to yourself, your Higher Power, and another trusted human being. This will free your core. And remember to do this process on a daily basis (the 10<sup>th</sup> step), so that you can keep your core free when new angers creep back into your life.</p>\n</body>\n</html>\n",

No matter how much you think you can control your feelings, no matter how well adjusted you think you are, no matter how well you like the 12 steps, every now and then something will happen that will upset you. The key is to not let that bird build a nest in your head. People, places, and things cannot control your emotions. They are just emotional triggers. Remember, you make yourself feel a certain way in response to the trigger. You can also quickly change how you respond.</p>\n<p class=\"p4\"><br></p>\n<p class=\"p3\"><span class=\"Apple-tab-span\">\t</span>TO DO:<span class=\"Apple-converted-space\">  </span>What's a good way to get that bird to fly away? One way is to try to recognize your feeling, and then to try to change the bad feeling to a positive feeling. To do so, you can start by using this app. You can also ask yourself if the trigger is worth being upset about. You can also try applying the 12 steps to the feeling. First, admit that you are powerless to handle it alone. Then, turn the problem over to a Higher Power. That Higher Power may be a consultation with a sponsor, a therapist, or your God.<span class=\"Apple-converted-space\">  </span>Maybe take an inventory and see where your own sensitivity may be contributing to the problem. If you can determine what the character sensitivity or issue is, tell someone else. If you can't determine what it is, discuss the situation with someone else. Try to find<span class=\"Apple-converted-space\">  </span><span class=\"s1\">your </span>defect and not the defect in the person you think is causing the problem. Once you find the defect, ask God to remove it.</p>\n<p class=\"p3\"><span class=\"Apple-tab-span\">\t</span>If the problem causes resentment, pray for the person who you think is causing the resentment.<span class=\"Apple-converted-space\"> </span></p>\n<p class=\"p3\"><span class=\"Apple-tab-span\">\t</span><span class=\"Apple-converted-space\">    </span>Remember to ask God that His will be done, not yours. And most importantly, try to help someone who is new to recovery. By getting out of yourself and helping another, you may be grateful that your problem is not as bad as the other person. You may gain perspective. Your attention will be re-focused.<span class=\"Apple-converted-space\">  </span>By doing what it takes to get the bird off your head, you will avoid finding yourself saying, <b>\"If I get drunk, I won't be able to think about it.\"</b></p>\n<p class=\"p5\"><br></p>\n</body>\n</html>\n",

Soon the pain will pass. There will be no explanation for your suffering so don't even try to find one. Crying is absolutely acceptable. Owning your feelings without attaching any intellectual sense to them is sometimes quite healthy. Know that soon your pain will pass. Know that when it passes you will have a greater appreciation for not having that pain. Y<b>ou will also feel incredibly good (rocketed into the 4<sup>th</sup> dimension) when you realize that you did not have to drink, use or act out in order to survive the pain!</b></p>\n<p class=\"p4\"><br></p>\n<p class=\"p3\">TO DO: Ride out the pain by supporting your head lovingly in your own hands. It's okay to call someone and share it.

You probably will forget what's troubling you, but you probably won't forget if you let the symptoms of depression make you drink, eat, drug, spend hours on the internet, ruin your sleep, make you lose interest in things you used to enjoy, and otherwise ruin your day. Most times, it is the initial shock that hurts when we are confronted with an issue. Often, it is a little thing that starts us spiraling downward. It is important to not \"sweat the small stuff\". It is important to nip bad feelings in the bud.  </p>\n<p class=\"p3\">           <span class=\"Apple-converted-space\"> </span></p>\n<p class=\"p3\">           TO DO: You should use a <b>recovery tool</b> to get over the shock and forget what's bothering you, like sharing the problem with a friend, going to a meeting, journaling, deep breathing and more. Writing down something that bothers you and throwing it in the trash might help. Don't sweep your problems under the rug, deal with them one at a time. But there is a time to forget about them. Writing down 5 things you are grateful for (like being able to walk, living in a safe place, having food, etc.) may change your attitude.</p>\n<p class=\"p2\"><br></p>\n<p class=\"p4\"><br></p>\n</body>\n</html>\n",

The problem with anger according to most of my patients is that \"it comes on so suddenly\". This is why daily practice to deal with anger is so critical. First, a third step prayer to start the day is essential to align one's will with God's will. This alignment removes stress induced by our small minded, egotistically imbalanced desires. Second, throughout the day, taking breaks every three hours to breathe slowly reduce the stress associated with living life like an overwhelmed juggernaut. These breathing breaks should be done before anger sets in and even on peaceful days. This proactive methodology (daily 3<sup>rd</sup> step prayer and breathing breaks) must become a habit. If anger starts, pick up the phone and share the cause with a safe person (Sponsor, friend, therapist) as soon as possible. The more anger builds, the more harm it can do to you and your relationships. Finally, as a last resort, always have an anger escape plan. For many of my patients, it's removal from the situation (\"I need to go to the restroom\", \"I need to make a call\"). If venting is necessary, a good place to do so includes yelling in one's parked car. Better to be slightly embarrassed by having to leave suddenly than to let anger dictate behavior which may be irreparable.</p>\n<p class=\"p2\"><br></p>\n<p class=\"p1\">To Do: Deal with anger proactively even if you are not angry. Share your anger with a safe person. Get anger out in safe ways.<span class=\"Apple-converted-space\"> </span></p>\n<p class=\"p2\"><br></p>\n<p class=\"p3\"><br></p>\n</body>\n</html>\n",

As I consciously told myself of reasons to be grateful for him, my anger dissipated and I actually relaxed and felt happy. <b>If you can't think of a reason to be grateful for something that the offending person did for you, focus on the fact that the person has given you the opportunity to practice good character attributes like patience and forgiveness and understanding. </b>This practice will help improve your personality and make it easier the next time someone interferes with your rights.</p>\n<p class=\"p2\">To Do: Has any family member caused you resentment or are you angry at someone? Think of something you are grateful for about that person, even if it's just that you he has given you an opportunity to grow. You are doing great by switching your attitude.

Always test your first thought by thinking of its consequences (good and bad) and always think of possible alternative thoughts before you act. Especially with addicts, our first thoughts tend to be harmful to ourselves and others. For example, usually our first thought when confronted with stress, anger or some other negative emotion is to lash out, withdraw, or escape by picking up our first drug of choice. This just causes more conflict, stress, anger and resentment. We consequently regret acting upon our first thoughts. Acting upon our first thought is called a <i>reaction.<span class=\"Apple-converted-space\">  </span></i>In recovery, we learn to \"act upon\", not react, and this makes our lives easier. When our lives are easier, we don't want to act out to avoid life so we stay sober and we make better decisions.</p>\n<p class=\"p2\"><br></p>\n<p class=\"p1\"><span class=\"Apple-tab-span\">\t</span>To Do: Move on to the second thought.

Addicts tend to be control freaks. We think we know what's right and how to do it and what everyone else should do. We want to run the show. Often with the best of intentions, we tell people what to do. The only problem is that we forget that they usually don't want to hear what we have to say- especially if we are newly sober because we have made such a mess out of our own lives that we have nothing to back up what we are saying.</p>\n<p class=\"p3\"><span class=\"Apple-tab-span\">\t</span>The twelve steps teach us that we are not in charge- that everyone (including ourselves) is much better off if we turn our control over to our Higher Power.<span class=\"Apple-converted-space\">  </span>Usually, this means that we just try to do what's in front of us without controlling people, places or things. Rather, we should just accept what is and remember everything is not about us or our way.</p>\n<p class=\"p3\"><span class=\"Apple-tab-span\">\t</span>Getting out of the way means letting go of our need to control things we cannot.

A good way to relax is to ask yourself if you really are in trouble or is it just your anxious brain talking? Addicts overanalyze. We worry about outcomes. We try to control what we cannot. We tend to think negatively. We tend to ignore good things, and dwell on bad things. Addicts use and act out to try to change their irritating brains. Unfortunately, substances and addictive behaviors not only change our brains but cause us to break laws, end up in hospitals, lose God, and ruin relationships. A better way to change our brains is to surround ourselves with recovering people who care about us, exercise, eat correctly, practice the 12 steps, and share our secrets with Sponsors.</p>\n<p class=\"p2\"><br></p>\n<p class=\"p1\">To Do: Tell yourself to stop thinking. Get out of your head and into your heart. Instead reach out to help someone or do something to serve your Higher Power. Sometimes that service can be not making a problem worse or just taking a break for a peaceful walk or some other fun activity.</p>\n<p class=\"p2\"><br></p>\n<p class=\"p3\"><br></p>\n</body>\n</html>\n",

Always test your first thought by thinking of its consequences (good and bad) and always think of possible alternative thoughts before you act.

For example, usually our first thought when confronted with stress, anger or some other negative emotion is to lash out, withdraw, or escape by picking up our first drug of choice. This just causes more conflict, stress, anger and resentment. We consequently regret acting upon our first thoughts. Acting upon our first thought is called a <i>reaction.<span class=\"Apple-converted-space\">  </span></i>In recovery, we learn to \"act upon\", not react, and this makes our lives easier.

Most times, it is the initial shock that hurts when we are confronted with an issue. Often, it is a little thing that starts us spiraling downward. It is important to not \"sweat the small stuff\". It is important to nip bad feelings in the bud.  </p>\n<p class=\"p3\">           <span class=\"Apple-converted-space\"> </span></p>\n<p class=\"p3\">           TO DO: You should use a <b>recovery tool</b> to get over the shock and forget what's bothering you, like sharing the problem with a friend, going to a meeting, journaling, deep breathing and more. Writing down something that bothers you and throwing it in the trash might help. Don't sweep your problems under the rug, deal with them one at a time. But there is a time to forget about them. Writing down 5 things you are grateful for (like being able to walk, living in a safe place, having food, etc.) may change your attitude.</p>\n<p class=\"p2\"><br></p>\n<p class=\"p4\"><br></p>\n</body>\n</html>\n",

Crack, internet porn picture, you are sorely mistaken. Picking up the first one relieves nothing. It just creates more craving. The only way to get rid of the craving is to not pick up, and the only way to not pick up is to think through picking up the first one to its bitter end. Then using a recovery tool like calling someone and talking about your craving.</p>\n<p class=\"p1\">To Do: using doesn't relieve cravings so pick up a recovery tool instead of picking up the drug or process you are craving. You don't have to use just because you crave.

No need to immediately intellectualize a response; just absorb it until the instinct to fight or flight passes.

Fight or flight does not work as well as compromise.</p>\n<p class=\"p2\">To Do: Imagine the shock is a snake. Most snakes are harmless. In any event, you don't need to run away or lash out at it. Just gently support your head and breathe slowly and the snake will be hypnotized. We can't do anything productive in shock. We must let it pass.

Always test your first thought by thinking of its consequences (good and bad) and always think of possible alternative thoughts before you act.

For example, usually our first thought when confronted with stress, anger or some other negative emotion is to lash out, withdraw, or escape by picking up our first drug of choice. This just causes more conflict, stress, anger and resentment. We consequently regret acting upon our first thoughts. Acting upon our first thought is called a <i>reaction.<span class=\"Apple-converted-space\">  </span></i>In recovery, we learn to \"act upon\", not react, and this makes our lives easier.

Once you have reached the top of your head, start noticing your surroundings. Then do your next daily activity, keeping your mind focused on what you are doing.

Is that your addict voice or is that your recovery voice?<span class=\"Apple-converted-space\">  </span>Because addiction is a chronic disease, we will always have an addict voice. The key to keeping it in remission is to substitute the messages our addict voice gives us with the messages our recovery voice learns at 12 step meetings and in therapy. Your addict voice will speak to you in your style of speech in an attractive, encouraging voice. It will try to get you to use. It will try to persuade you in a way only you can understand to use \"just one\" or to not go to a meeting or to not do your morning ritual because you are too busy. It will try to tell you you're cured so you can have just one. A key to sobriety is recognizing and doing the opposite of that voice. Your addict voice causes you fear and stress. It takes a personality change to keep the addict voice quiet.</p>\n<p class=\"p2\"><br></p>\n<p class=\"p1\">To Do: Listen to the addict voice as you go through your day and substitute its advice with your recovery voice. Connect to your Higher Power and ask his help to change voices. This will keep you sober and at peace.

Even if the consequences of relapse are delayed, it will end up bad because you will think you didn't have a problem so you will likely try to return to drinking like a \"normal\" person, and eventually you'll start drinking or using more and more and then you will be out of control and suffer consequences.<span class=\"Apple-converted-space\"> </span></p>\n<p class=\"p2\"><br></p>\n<p class=\"p1\">TO DO: Remember that you risk prompt, disastrous consequences if you pick up the first drink or drug after a period of sobriety.

Always test your first thought by thinking of its consequences (good and bad) and always think of possible alternative thoughts before you act. Especially with addicts, our first thoughts tend to be harmful to ourselves and others. For example, usually our first thought when confronted with stress, anger or some other negative emotion is to lash out, withdraw, or escape by picking up our first drug of choice. This just causes more conflict, stress, anger and resentment. We consequently regret acting upon our first thoughts. Acting upon our first thought is called a <i>reaction.<span class=\"Apple-converted-space\">  </span></i>In recovery, we learn to \"act upon\", not react, and this makes our lives easier.

A good way to relax is to ask yourself if you really are in trouble or is it just your anxious brain talking? Addicts overanalyze. We worry about outcomes. We try to control what we cannot. We tend to think negatively. We tend to ignore good things, and dwell on bad things. Addicts use and act out to try to change their irritating brains. Unfortunately, substances and addictive behaviors not only change our brains but cause us to break laws, end up in hospitals, lose God, and ruin relationships. A better way to change our brains is to surround ourselves with recovering people who care about us, exercise, eat correctly, practice the 12 steps, and share our secrets with Sponsors.</p>\n<p class=\"p2\"><br></p>\n<p class=\"p1\">To Do: Tell yourself to stop thinking. Get out of your head and into your heart. Instead reach out to help someone or do something to serve your Higher Power. Sometimes that service can be not making a problem worse or just taking a break for a peaceful walk or some other fun activity.</p>\n<p class=\"p2\"><br></p>\n<p class=\"p3\"><br></p>\n</body>\n</html>\n",

Writing down something that bothers you and throwing it in the trash might help. Don't sweep your problems under the rug, deal with them one at a time. But there is a time to forget about them.

Is that your addict voice or is that your recovery voice?<span class=\"Apple-converted-space\">  </span>Because addiction is a chronic disease, we will always have an addict voice. The key to keeping it in remission is to substitute the messages our addict voice gives us with the messages our recovery voice learns at 12 step meetings and in therapy. Your addict voice will speak to you in your style of speech in an attractive, encouraging voice. It will try to get you to use. It will try to persuade you in a way only you can understand to use \"just one\" or to not go to a meeting or to not do your morning ritual because you are too busy. It will try to tell you you're cured so you can have just one. A key to sobriety is recognizing and doing the opposite of that voice. Your addict voice causes you fear and stress. It takes a personality change to keep the addict voice quiet.</p>\n<p class=\"p2\"><br></p>\n<p class=\"p1\">To Do: Listen to the addict voice as you go through your day and substitute its advice with your recovery voice. Connect to your Higher Power and ask his help to change voices. This will keep you sober and at peace. Good for you for using this App to change voices!</p>\n<p class=\"p3\"><br></p>\n</body>\n</html>\n",

Is that your addict voice or is that your recovery voice?<span class=\"Apple-converted-space\">  </span>Because addiction is a chronic disease, we will always have an addict voice. The key to keeping it in remission is to substitute the messages our addict voice gives us with the messages our recovery voice learns at 12 step meetings and in therapy. Your addict voice will speak to you in your style of speech in an attractive, encouraging voice. It will try to get you to use. It will try to persuade you in a way only you can understand to use \"just one\" or to not go to a meeting or to not do your morning ritual because you are too busy. It will try to tell you you're cured so you can have just one. A key to sobriety is recognizing and doing the opposite of that voice. Your addict voice causes you fear and stress. It takes a personality change to keep the addict voice quiet.</p>\n<p class=\"p2\"><br></p>\n<p class=\"p1\">To Do: Listen to the addict voice as you go through your day and substitute its advice with your recovery voice. Connect to your Higher Power and ask his help to change voices. This will keep you sober and at peace. Good for you for using this App to change voices!</p>\n<p class=\"p3\"><br></p>\n</body>\n</html>\n",

No matter how much you think you can control your feelings, no matter how well adjusted you think you are, no matter how well you like the 12 steps, every now and then something will happen that will upset you or trigger sadness. The key is to not let that bird build a nest in your head. People, places, and things cannot control your emotions. They are just emotional triggers.

One way is to try to recognize your feeling, and then to try to change the bad feeling to a positive feeling. To do so, you can start by using this app. You can also ask yourself if the trigger is worth being upset about. You can also try applying the 12 steps to the feeling. First, admit that you are powerless to handle it alone. Then, turn the problem over to a Higher Power. That Higher Power may be a consultation with a sponsor, a therapist, or your God.<span class=\"Apple-converted-space\">  </span>Maybe take an inventory and see where your own sensitivity may be contributing to the problem. If you can determine what the character sensitivity or issue is, tell someone else. If you can't determine what it is, discuss the situation with someone else. Try to find<span class=\"Apple-converted-space\">  </span><span class=\"s1\">your </span>defect and not the defect in the person you think is causing the problem. Once you find the defect, ask God to remove it.</p>\n<p class=\"p3\"><span class=\"Apple-tab-span\">\t</span>If the problem causes resentment, pray for the person who you think is causing the resentment.<span class=\"Apple-converted-space\"> </span></p>\n<p class=\"p3\"><span class=\"Apple-tab-span\">\t</span><span class=\"Apple-converted-space\">    </span>Remember to ask God that His will be done, not yours.

You may gain perspective. Your attention will be re-focused.<span class=\"Apple-converted-space\">  </span>By doing what it takes to get the bird off your head, you will avoid finding yourself saying, <b>\"If I get drunk, I won't be able to think about it.\"</b></p>\n<p class=\"p5\"><br></p>\n</body>\n</html>\n",

A friend was doing well with \"happy\" and \"free\" but struggling with \"joy\" until his Sponsor asked him, \"What is the first thing that comes to your mind that you are grateful for and did not create?\"<span class=\"Apple-converted-space\">  </span>My friend replied, \"Well I woke up today, I didn't come to\" and spontaneously laughed with <i>joy</i>!</p>\n<p class=\"p2\"><br></p>\n<p class=\"p1\">To Do: Keep a grateful heart to feel the joy that obliterates nervousness, sadness, and fear.</p>\n<p class=\"p3\"><br></p>\n</body>\n</html>\n",

While holding down the \"program\" button, I pressed the \"advance time\" button, but the time did not change. There was no way I was doing the procedure incorrectly. But the time would not set. Therefore, I could not program the coffee maker to have my precious coffee ready when I woke up. Another example: a troubled client sends me a threatening email on the first day of my vacation. Another example: a young couple is told that they can never have children.<span class=\"Apple-converted-space\"> </span></p>\n<p class=\"p2\"><br></p>\n<p class=\"p1\">From little issues like my coffee maker not working to life challenges like being told you can never have children, there are times when you cannot fix a problem, you can only deal with it so that it does not destroy your serenity or the manageability of your life. There are times when events are going to be a trigger for sadness or self pity.</p>\n<p class=\"p2\"><br></p>\n<p class=\"p1\">To Do: Practice acceptance, not judgment. Although unexpected and unfair, accept that each of us must deal with adversity. Don't feel like you must bear sadness alone. Ask friends and therapists for guidance and support. Create a plan to deal with adversity. Perhaps, you will have to be a bit more patient to deal with an unexpected problem. Perhaps you will have to reprioritize certain life goals to best play the new deck of cards you have been given.</p>\n<p class=\"p3\"><br></p>\n</body>\n</html>\n",

This just causes more conflict, stress, anger and resentment. We consequently regret acting upon our first thoughts. Acting upon our first thought is called a <i>reaction.<span class=\"Apple-converted-space\">  </span></i>In recovery, we learn to \"act upon\", not react, and this makes our lives easier.

You probably will forget what's troubling you, but you probably won't forget if you let the symptoms of depression make you drink, eat, drug, spend hours on the internet, ruin your sleep, make you lose interest in things you used to enjoy, and otherwise ruin your day. Most times, it is the initial shock that hurts when we are confronted with an issue. Often, it is a little thing that starts us spiraling downward. It is important to not \"sweat the small stuff\". It is important to nip bad feelings in the bud.  </p>\n<p class=\"p3\">           <span class=\"Apple-converted-space\"> </span></p>\n<p class=\"p3\">           TO DO: You should use a <b>recovery tool</b> to get over the shock and forget what's bothering you, like sharing the problem with a friend, going to a meeting, journaling, deep breathing and more. Writing down something that bothers you and throwing it in the trash might help. Don't sweep your problems under the rug, deal with them one at a time. But there is a time to forget about them. Writing down 5 things you are grateful for (like being able to walk, living in a safe place, having food, etc.) may change your attitude.</p>\n<p class=\"p2\"><br></p>\n<p class=\"p4\"><br></p>\n</body>\n</html>\n",

No matter how much you think you can control your feelings, no matter how well adjusted you think you are, no matter how well you like the 12 steps, every now and then something will happen that will upset you. The key is to not let that bird build a nest in your head. People, places, and things cannot control your emotions. They are just emotional triggers. Remember, you make yourself feel a certain way in response to the trigger. You can also quickly change how you respond.</p>\n<p class=\"p4\"><br></p>\n<p class=\"p3\"><span class=\"Apple-tab-span\">\t</span>TO DO:<span class=\"Apple-converted-space\">  </span>What's a good way to get that bird to fly away? One way is to try to recognize your feeling, and then to try to change the bad feeling to a positive feeling. To do so, you can start by using this app. You can also ask yourself if the trigger is worth being upset about. You can also try applying the 12 steps to the feeling. First, admit that you are powerless to handle it alone. Then, turn the problem over to a Higher Power. That Higher Power may be a consultation with a sponsor, a therapist, or your God.<span class=\"Apple-converted-space\">  </span>Maybe take an inventory and see where your own sensitivity may be contributing to the problem. If you can determine what the character sensitivity or issue is, tell someone else. If you can't determine what it is, discuss the situation with someone else. Try to find<span class=\"Apple-converted-space\">  </span><span class=\"s1\">your </span>defect and not the defect in the person you think is causing the problem. Once you find the defect, ask God to remove it.</p>\n<p class=\"p3\"><span class=\"Apple-tab-span\">\t</span>If the problem causes resentment, pray for the person who you think is causing the resentment.<span class=\"Apple-converted-space\"> </span></p>\n<p class=\"p3\"><span class=\"Apple-tab-span\">\t</span><span class=\"Apple-converted-space\">    </span>Remember to ask God that His will be done, not yours. And most importantly, try to help someone who is new to recovery. By getting out of yourself and helping another, you may be grateful that your problem is not as bad as the other person. You may gain perspective. Your attention will be re-focused.<span class=\"Apple-converted-space\">  </span>By doing what it takes to get the bird off your head, you will avoid finding yourself saying, <b>\"If I get drunk, I won't be able to think about it.\"</b></p>\n<p class=\"p5\"><br></p>\n</body>\n</html>\n",

No need to immediately intellectualize a response; just absorb it until the instinct to fight or flight passes. If these instincts don't pass, call someone safe like a sponsor or friend to discuss the problem. This strategy will keep the problem from becoming trouble. Fight or flight does not work as well as compromise.</p>\n<p class=\"p2\">To Do: Imagine the shock is a snake. Most snakes are harmless. In any event, you don't need to run away or lash out at it. Just gently support your head and breathe slowly and the snake will be hypnotized. We can't do anything productive in shock. We must let it pass. Only when the instinct to fight or flee passes can we think of a rational, sober solution to a problem.</p>\n<p class=\"p3\"><br></p>\n</body>\n</html>\n",

Always test your first thought by thinking of its consequences (good and bad) and always think of possible alternative thoughts before you act.

For example, usually our first thought when confronted with stress, anger or some other negative emotion is to lash out, withdraw, or escape by picking up our first drug of choice. This just causes more conflict, stress, anger and resentment. We consequently regret acting upon our first thoughts. Acting upon our first thought is called a <i>reaction.<span class=\"Apple-converted-space\">  </span></i>In recovery, we learn to \"act upon\", not react, and this makes our lives easier.

Addicts tend to be control freaks. We think we know what's right and how to do it and what everyone else should do. We want to run the show. Often with the best of intentions, we tell people what to do. The only problem is that we forget that they usually don't want to hear what we have to say- especially if we are newly sober because we have made such a mess out of our own lives that we have nothing to back up what we are saying.</p>\n<p class=\"p3\"><span class=\"Apple-tab-span\">\t</span>The twelve steps teach us that we are not in charge- that everyone (including ourselves) is much better off if we turn our control over to our Higher Power.<span class=\"Apple-converted-space\">  </span>Usually, this means that we just try to do what's in front of us without controlling people, places or things. Rather, we should just accept what is and remember everything is not about us or our way.</p>\n<p class=\"p3\"><span class=\"Apple-tab-span\">\t</span>Getting out of the way means letting go of our need to control things we cannot.

A good way to relax is to ask yourself if you really are in trouble or is it just your anxious brain talking? Addicts overanalyze. We worry about outcomes. We try to control what we cannot. We tend to think negatively. We tend to ignore good things, and dwell on bad things. Addicts use and act out to try to change their irritating brains. Unfortunately, substances and addictive behaviors not only change our brains but cause us to break laws, end up in hospitals, lose God, and ruin relationships. A better way to change our brains is to surround ourselves with recovering people who care about us, exercise, eat correctly, practice the 12 steps, and share our secrets with Sponsors.</p>\n<p class=\"p2\"><br></p>\n<p class=\"p1\">To Do: Tell yourself to stop thinking. Get out of your head and into your heart. Instead reach out to help someone or do something to serve your Higher Power. Sometimes that service can be not making a problem worse or just taking a break for a peaceful walk or some other fun activity.</p>\n<p class=\"p2\"><br></p>\n<p class=\"p3\"><br></p>\n</body>\n</html>\n",

Exercise mindfulness. Mindfulness means that you are slowly breathing and keeping your mind in the moment. Start by looking at your feet, squeezing your foot muscles, then slowly working your way upward. Take your time, breathing slowly. Once you have reached the top of your head, start noticing your surroundings. Then do your next daily activity, keeping your mind focused on what you are doing. Don't live in the future or the past.</p>\n<p class=\"p3\"><br></p>\n<p class=\"p4\"><br></p>\n</body>\n</html>\n",

Soon the pain will pass. There will be no explanation for your suffering so don't even try to find one. Crying is absolutely acceptable. Owning your feelings without attaching any intellectual sense to them is sometimes quite healthy. Know that soon your pain will pass. Know that when it passes you will have a greater appreciation for not having that pain. Y<b>ou will also feel incredibly good (rocketed into the 4<sup>th</sup> dimension) when you realize that you did not have to drink, use or act out in order to survive the pain!</b></p>\n<p class=\"p4\"><br></p>\n<p class=\"p3\">TO DO: Ride out the pain by supporting your head lovingly in your own hands.

You probably will forget what's troubling you, but you probably won't forget if you let the symptoms of depression make you drink, eat, drug, spend hours on the internet, ruin your sleep, make you lose interest in things you used to enjoy, and otherwise ruin your day. Most times, it is the initial shock that hurts when we are confronted with an issue. Often, it is a little thing that starts us spiraling downward. It is important to not \"sweat the small stuff\". It is important to nip bad feelings in the bud.  </p>\n<p class=\"p3\">           <span class=\"Apple-converted-space\"> </span></p>\n<p class=\"p3\">           TO DO: You should use a <b>recovery tool</b> to get over the shock and forget what's bothering you, like sharing the problem with a friend, going to a meeting, journaling, deep breathing and more. Writing down something that bothers you and throwing it in the trash might help. Don't sweep your problems under the rug, deal with them one at a time. But there is a time to forget about them. Writing down 5 things you are grateful for (like being able to walk, living in a safe place, having food, etc.) may change your attitude.</p>\n<p class=\"p2\"><br></p>\n<p class=\"p4\"><br></p>\n</body>\n</html>\n",

Although unexpected and unfair, accept that each of us must deal with adversity. Don't feel like you must bear it alone. Ask friends and therapists for guidance and support. Create a plan to deal with adversity. Perhaps, you will have to be a bit more patient to deal with an unexpected problem. Perhaps you will have to reprioritize certain life goals to best play the new deck of cards you have been given.</p>\n<p class=\"p3\"><br></p>\n</body>\n</html>\n",

Don't let that confusion make you use. Remember, no one has all the answers. And anyone, who thinks he does, is misleading himself. If you are unsure of whether or not you are an addict, don't automatically deny that you are. Rather, give treatment a chance and see if your life is easier (with less bad consequences) when you are not using. If you are confused about whether or not you can have a Higher Power, remember that you don't have to have a perfect idea of one. Many addicts use the group as a Higher Power. Ask yourself whether or not your drug of choice had become a harmful Higher Power and whether or not it's time to pick a healing Higher Power. If you think you know how to stay sober on your own, you probably have a lot to learn, particularly if you have tried to stop using on your own before. So get to treatment and a meeting. If you think you are going to make the perfect decision with results that will work out exactly as planned, you have a lot to learn.<span class=\"Apple-converted-space\"> </span></p>\n<p class=\"p2\"><br></p>\n<p class=\"p1\">To Do: It's time to let go of knowing everything.

Most times, it is the initial shock that hurts when we are confronted with an issue. Often, it is a little thing that starts us spiraling downward. It is important to not \"sweat the small stuff\". It is important to nip bad feelings in the bud.  </p>\n<p class=\"p3\">           <span class=\"Apple-converted-space\"> </span></p>\n<p class=\"p3\">           TO DO: You should use a <b>recovery tool</b> to get over the shock and forget what's bothering you, like sharing the problem with a friend, going to a meeting, journaling, deep breathing and more. Writing down something that bothers you and throwing it in the trash might help. Don't sweep your problems under the rug, deal with them one at a time. But there is a time to forget about them. Writing down 5 things you are grateful for (like being able to walk, living in a safe place, having food, etc.) may change your attitude.</p>\n<p class=\"p2\"><br></p>\n<p class=\"p4\"><br></p>\n</body>\n</html>\n",

You probably will forget what's troubling you, but you probably won't forget if you let the symptoms of depression make you drink, eat, drug, spend hours on the internet, ruin your sleep, make you lose interest in things you used to enjoy, and otherwise ruin your day. Most times, it is the initial shock that hurts when we are confronted with an issue. Often, it is a little thing that starts us spiraling downward. It is important to not \"sweat the small stuff\". It is important to nip bad feelings in the bud.  </p>\n<p class=\"p3\">           <span class=\"Apple-converted-space\"> </span></p>\n<p class=\"p3\">           TO DO: You should use a <b>recovery tool</b> to get over the shock and forget what's bothering you, like sharing the problem with a friend, going to a meeting, journaling, deep breathing and more. Writing down something that bothers you and throwing it in the trash might help. Don't sweep your problems under the rug, deal with them one at a time. But there is a time to forget about them. Writing down 5 things you are grateful for (like being able to walk, living in a safe place, having food, etc.) may change your attitude.</p>\n<p class=\"p2\"><br></p>\n<p class=\"p4\"><br></p>\n</body>\n</html>\n",

The snakes are bills, bosses, complicated financial news, health insurance issues, friends committing suicide, etc. Our bodies initial responses are to fight or flight. Both of these responses only escalate the problem, escalate the stress, and escalate the risk of relapse.</p>\n<p class=\"p2\"><span class=\"Apple-tab-span\">\t</span>When given shocking news that appears threatening, the first step to sobriety is just absorbing the blow, and not reacting. No need to immediately intellectualize a response; just absorb it until the instinct to fight or flight passes. If these instincts don't pass, call someone safe like a sponsor or friend to discuss the problem. This strategy will keep the problem from becoming trouble. Fight or flight does not work as well as compromise.</p>\n<p class=\"p2\">To Do: Imagine the shock is a snake. Most snakes are harmless. In any event, you don't need to run away or lash out at it. Just gently support your head and breathe slowly and the snake will be hypnotized. We can't do anything productive in shock. We must let it pass. Only when the instinct to fight or flee passes can we think of a rational, sober solution to a problem.</p>\n<p class=\"p3\"><br></p>\n</body>\n</html>\n",

Always test your first thought by thinking of its consequences (good and bad) and always think of possible alternative thoughts before you act. Especially with addicts, our first thoughts tend to be harmful to ourselves and others. For example, usually our first thought when confronted with stress, anger or some other negative emotion is to lash out, withdraw, or escape by picking up our first drug of choice. This just causes more conflict, stress, anger and resentment. We consequently regret acting upon our first thoughts. Acting upon our first thought is called a <i>reaction.<span class=\"Apple-converted-space\">  </span></i>In recovery, we learn to \"act upon\", not react, and this makes our lives easier.

Addicts tend to be control freaks. We think we know what's right and how to do it and what everyone else should do. We want to run the show. Often with the best of intentions, we tell people what to do. The only problem is that we forget that they usually don't want to hear what we have to say- especially if we are newly sober because we have made such a mess out of our own lives that we have nothing to back up what we are saying.</p>\n<p class=\"p3\"><span class=\"Apple-tab-span\">\t</span>The twelve steps teach us that we are not in charge- that everyone (including ourselves) is much better off if we turn our control over to our Higher Power.<span class=\"Apple-converted-space\">  </span>Usually, this means that we just try to do what's in front of us without controlling people, places or things. Rather, we should just accept what is and remember everything is not about us or our way.</p>\n<p class=\"p3\"><span class=\"Apple-tab-span\">\t</span>Getting out of the way means letting go of our need to control things we cannot. This keeps us from picking up the first drink because we lose the frustration that comes with doing the impossible.

A good way to relax is to ask yourself if you really are in trouble or is it just your anxious brain talking? Addicts overanalyze. We worry about outcomes. We try to control what we cannot. We tend to think negatively. We tend to ignore good things, and dwell on bad things. Addicts use and act out to try to change their irritating brains. Unfortunately, substances and addictive behaviors not only change our brains but cause us to break laws, end up in hospitals, lose God, and ruin relationships. A better way to change our brains is to surround ourselves with recovering people who care about us, exercise, eat correctly, practice the 12 steps, and share our secrets with Sponsors.</p>\n<p class=\"p2\"><br></p>\n<p class=\"p1\">To Do: Tell yourself to stop thinking. Get out of your head and into your heart. Instead reach out to help someone or do something to serve your Higher Power. Sometimes that service can be not making a problem worse or just taking a break for a peaceful walk or some other fun activity.</p>\n<p class=\"p2\"><br></p>\n<p class=\"p3\"><br></p>\n</body>\n</html>\n",

Don't let that confusion make you use. Remember, no one has all the answers. And anyone, who thinks he does, is misleading himself.

Rather, give treatment a chance and see if your life is easier (with less bad consequences) when you are not using. If you are confused about whether or not you can have a Higher Power, remember that you don't have to have a perfect idea of one. Many addicts use the group as a Higher Power. Ask yourself whether or not your drug of choice had become a harmful Higher Power and whether or not it's time to pick a healing Higher Power. If you think you know how to stay sober on your own, you probably have a lot to learn, particularly if you have tried to stop using on your own before. So get to treatment and a meeting. If you think you are going to make the perfect decision with results that will work out exactly as planned, you have a lot to learn.<span class=\"Apple-converted-space\"> </span></p>\n<p class=\"p2\"><br></p>\n<p class=\"p1\">To Do: It's time to let go of knowing everything.

It might be a good idea to start with step 4 to see what character defect is causing you to struggle. Then you might need to get rid of that defect by doing steps 5-7. Usually over controlling is a problem, so step 1 applies: powerlessness over people, places, and things.</p>\n<p class=\"p4\"><br></p>\n<p class=\"p5\">To Do: Live the steps and apply each step beginning with step one to specific issues. This will reduce stress and help you make better decisions. It will also keep little things from building up, overwhelming you, confusing you, and leading you to want to escape by using.</p>\n</body>\n</html>\n",

You probably will forget what's troubling you, but you probably won't forget if you let the symptoms of depression make you drink, eat, drug, spend hours on the internet, ruin your sleep, make you lose interest in things you used to enjoy, and otherwise ruin your day. Most times, it is the initial shock that hurts when we are confronted with an issue. Often, it is a little thing that starts us spiraling downward. It is important to not \"sweat the small stuff\". It is important to nip bad feelings in the bud.  </p>\n<p class=\"p3\">           <span class=\"Apple-converted-space\"> </span></p>\n<p class=\"p3\">           TO DO: You should use a <b>recovery tool</b> to get over the shock and forget what's bothering you, like sharing the problem with a friend, going to a meeting, journaling, deep breathing and more. Writing down something that bothers you and throwing it in the trash might help. Don't sweep your problems under the rug, deal with them one at a time. But there is a time to forget about them. Writing down 5 things you are grateful for (like being able to walk, living in a safe place, having food, etc.) may change your attitude.</p>\n<p class=\"p2\"><br></p>\n<p class=\"p4\"><br></p>\n</body>\n</html>\n",

Therefore, I could not program the coffee maker to have my precious coffee ready when I woke up. Another example: a troubled client sends me a threatening email on the first day of my vacation. Another example: a young couple is told that they can never have children.<span class=\"Apple-converted-space\"> </span></p>\n<p class=\"p2\"><br></p>\n<p class=\"p1\">From little issues like my coffee maker not working to life challenges like being told you can never have children, there are times when you cannot fix a problem, you can only deal with it so that it does not destroy your serenity or the manageability of your life.</p>\n<p class=\"p2\"><br></p>\n<p class=\"p1\">To Do: Practice acceptance, not judgment. Although unexpected and unfair, accept that each of us must deal with adversity. Don't feel like you must bear it alone. Ask friends and therapists for guidance and support. Create a plan to deal with adversity. Perhaps, you will have to be a bit more patient to deal with an unexpected problem. Perhaps you will have to reprioritize certain life goals to best play the new deck of cards you have been given.</p>\n<p class=\"p3\"><br></p>\n</body>\n</html>\n",

If you've never seen the inside of a baseball, it is tightly wound around a tiny rock hard center. You are like that baseball in that you have layer after layer of fears and resentments that are strangling your core (your true self). Your core can deal with reality; but your addiction consists of the layers of fears and resentments which make your core impotent. Once you cut through those layers by doing the 12 steps (particularly 4-7 and a daily 10<sup>th</sup>), you will free your core.<span class=\"Apple-converted-space\">  </span>And you will find that your core is this joyous being that can deal quite happily with reality without drugs.</p>\n<p class=\"p2\"><br></p>\n<p class=\"p4\">TO DO: Don't let your core strangle. Do a fourth step, a \"searching and fearless\" moral inventory to discover all your fears and resentments which are strangling your wonderful core. Then do a fifth step by admitting those fears and resentments to yourself, your Higher Power, and another trusted human being. This will free your core. And remember to do this process on a daily basis (the 10<sup>th</sup> step), so that you can keep your core free when new fears and resentments creep back into your life.</p>\n</body>\n</html>\n",

Is that your addict voice or is that your recovery voice?<span class=\"Apple-converted-space\">  </span>Because addiction is a chronic disease, we will always have an addict voice. The key to keeping it in remission is to substitute the messages our addict voice gives us with the messages our recovery voice learns at 12 step meetings and in therapy. Your addict voice will speak to you in your style of speech in an attractive, encouraging voice. It will try to get you to use. It will try to persuade you in a way only you can understand to use \"just one\" or to not go to a meeting or to not do your morning ritual because you are too busy. It will try to tell you you're cured so you can have just one. A key to sobriety is recognizing and doing the opposite of that voice. Your addict voice causes you fear and stress. It takes a personality change to keep the addict voice quiet.</p>\n<p class=\"p2\"><br></p>\n<p class=\"p1\">To Do: Listen to the addict voice as you go through your day and substitute its advice with your recovery voice. Connect to your Higher Power and ask his help to change voices. This will keep you sober and at peace. Good for you for using this App to change voices!</p>\n<p class=\"p3\"><br></p>\n</body>\n</html>\n",

Is that your addict voice or is that your recovery voice?<span class=\"Apple-converted-space\">  </span>Because addiction is a chronic disease, we will always have an addict voice. The key to keeping it in remission is to substitute the messages our addict voice gives us with the messages our recovery voice learns at 12 step meetings and in therapy. Your addict voice will speak to you in your style of speech in an attractive, encouraging voice. It will try to get you to use. It will try to persuade you in a way only you can understand to use \"just one\" or to not go to a meeting or to not do your morning ritual because you are too busy. It will try to tell you you're cured so you can have just one. A key to sobriety is recognizing and doing the opposite of that voice. Your addict voice causes you fear and stress. It takes a personality change to keep the addict voice quiet.</p>\n<p class=\"p2\"><br></p>\n<p class=\"p1\">To Do: Listen to the addict voice as you go through your day and substitute its advice with your recovery voice. Connect to your Higher Power and ask his help to change voices. This will keep you sober and at peace. Good for you for using this App to change voices!</p>\n<p class=\"p3\"><br></p>\n</body>\n</html>\n",

It starts with a decrease in 12 step meeting attendance, a decrease in contacting one's sponsor, and a decrease in living the 12 steps. Usually this decrease in daily recovery technique implementation occurs because the relapser believes he or she is cured. Therefore, something becomes more important than implementing a strong daily program. Without such a program, life's frustrations and temptations cannot be managed. Gradually, the relapser will be exposed to high risk situations which will allow him or her access to alcohol or drugs.<span class=\"Apple-converted-space\">  </span>Finally, the relapser will fantasize about the \"good things\" of using, groom for the use of the drug, and act out completing the relapse.</p>\n<p class=\"p3\"><br></p>\n<p class=\"p1\">TO DO: Ask yourself if something has greater priority for you than staying sober?

Ask yourself whether or not your drug of choice had become a harmful Higher Power and whether or not it's time to pick a healing Higher Power. If you think you know how to stay sober on your own, you probably have a lot to learn, particularly if you have tried to stop using on your own before. So get to treatment and a meeting.

Is that your addict voice or is that your recovery voice?<span class=\"Apple-converted-space\">  </span>Because addiction is a chronic disease, we will always have an addict voice. The key to keeping it in remission is to substitute the messages our addict voice gives us with the messages our recovery voice learns at 12 step meetings and in therapy. Your addict voice will speak to you in your style of speech in an attractive, encouraging voice. It will try to get you to use. It will try to persuade you in a way only you can understand to use \"just one\" or to not go to a meeting or to not do your morning ritual because you are too busy. It will try to tell you you're cured so you can have just one. A key to sobriety is recognizing and doing the opposite of that voice. Your addict voice causes you fear and stress. It takes a personality change to keep the addict voice quiet.</p>\n<p class=\"p2\"><br></p>\n<p class=\"p1\">To Do: Listen to the addict voice as you go through your day and substitute its advice with your recovery voice. Connect to your Higher Power and ask his help to change voices. This will keep you sober and at peace.

The key is to pick up a tool of the program before you pick up your drug of choice.<span class=\"Apple-converted-space\"> </span></p>\n<p class=\"p2\"><br></p>\n<p class=\"p1\">To Do: You are already headed back in the right direction just by reading this. Congratulations! Now take the next step and call your Sponsor or a friend in recovery, get to a meeting, call your therapist, say a prayer of thanks to your Higher Power. Reconnect to recovery.</p>\n<p class=\"p3\"><br></p>\n</body>\n</html>\n",

Doing the steps, cleaning up after meetings, helping others, sponsoring, service work, all are critical to the change you need to make in yourself. The Big Book says you can't rest on your laurels.

The key to keeping it in remission is to substitute the messages our addict voice gives us with the messages our recovery voice learns at 12 step meetings and in therapy. Your addict voice will speak to you in your style of speech in an attractive, encouraging voice. It will try to get you to use. It will try to persuade you in a way only you can understand to use \"just one\" or to not go to a meeting or to not do your morning ritual because you are too busy. It will try to tell you you're cured so you can have just one. A key to sobriety is recognizing and doing the opposite of that voice. Your addict voice causes you fear and stress. It takes a personality change to keep the addict voice quiet.</p>\n<p class=\"p2\"><br></p>\n<p class=\"p1\">To Do: Listen to the addict voice as you go through your day and substitute its advice with your recovery voice. Connect to your Higher Power and ask his help to change voices. This will keep you sober and at peace.

If you've never seen the inside of a baseball, it is tightly wound around a tiny rock hard center. You are like that baseball in that you have layer after layer of fears and resentments that are strangling your core (your true self). Your core can deal with reality; but your addiction consists of the layers of fears and resentments which make your core impotent. Once you cut through those layers by doing the 12 steps (particularly 4-7 and a daily 10<sup>th</sup>), you will free your core.<span class=\"Apple-converted-space\">  </span>And you will find that your core is this joyous being that can deal quite happily with reality without drugs.</p>\n<p class=\"p2\"><br></p>\n<p class=\"p4\">TO DO: Don't let your core strangle. Do a fourth step, a \"searching and fearless\" moral inventory to discover all your fears and resentments which are strangling your wonderful core. Then do a fifth step by admitting those fears and resentments to yourself, your Higher Power, and another trusted human being. This will free your core. And remember to do this process on a daily basis (the 10<sup>th</sup> step), so that you can keep your core free when new fears and resentments creep back into your life.</p>\n</body>\n</html>\n",

Learning is easier than faking knowing. Our addiction is tied to trying to look important. We drank and used because our egos wanted us to be more than what we were willing to accept. We had to put on facades, fake fronts to try to impress others. We tried to appear as if we knew it all, were totally in control, and were all powerful. But inside we knew differently so we escaped by using. The truth is that others knew we were frauds too. We ended up humiliated. In recovery, we turn this humiliation into humility. We recognize that we can accept ourselves even though we are not as important as we thought we had to be. We learn to appreciate ourselves for who we are, not some egomaniacal version of who we would like to be and who we would like others to think we are. We become openminded to learning, and this actually makes us feel better.<span class=\"Apple-converted-space\"> </span></p>\n<p class=\"p2\"><br></p>\n<p class=\"p1\">To Do: Ask someone for help, and follow their suggestion.

Know that when it passes you will have a greater appreciation for not having that pain.

This in turn will change how you feel. If I am resentful, I must think about resentment in a different way. Instead of bathing in it and feeling worse and worse, I must think about getting out of that bath and substituting resentment with empathy. But this change of thinking is only the beginning. I must combine my change of thinking with a new action whenever I begin to feel resentment. That new action may be praying for the person I resent to heal. It may be doing something else positive for my life so that I don't think about the resentment. It may be forgiving the person.</p>\n<p class=\"p2\"><br></p>\n<p class=\"p1\">To Do: To stay sober, we must change our thoughts and actions so that the feelings which used to drive us to use can't control us.

No matter how much you think you can control your feelings, no matter how well adjusted you think you are, no matter how well you like the 12 steps, every now and then something will happen that will upset you. The key is to not let that bird build a nest in your head. People, places, and things cannot control your emotions. They are just emotional triggers. Remember, you make yourself feel a certain way in response to the trigger.

One way is to try to recognize your feeling, and then to try to change the bad feeling to a positive feeling. To do so, you can start by using this app. You can also ask yourself if the trigger is worth being upset about. You can also try applying the 12 steps to the feeling. First, admit that you are powerless to handle it alone. Then, turn the problem over to a Higher Power. That Higher Power may be a consultation with a sponsor, a therapist, or your God.<span class=\"Apple-converted-space\">  </span>Maybe take an inventory and see where your own sensitivity may be contributing to the problem. If you can determine what the character sensitivity or issue is, tell someone else. If you can't determine what it is, discuss the situation with someone else. Try to find<span class=\"Apple-converted-space\">  </span><span class=\"s1\">your </span>defect and not the defect in the person you think is causing the problem. Once you find the defect, ask God to remove it.</p>\n<p class=\"p3\"><span class=\"Apple-tab-span\">\t</span>If the problem causes resentment, pray for the person who you think is causing the resentment.<span class=\"Apple-converted-space\"> </span></p>\n<p class=\"p3\"><span class=\"Apple-tab-span\">\t</span><span class=\"Apple-converted-space\">    </span>Remember to ask God that His will be done, not yours.

You may gain perspective. Your attention will be re-focused.<span class=\"Apple-converted-space\">  </span>By doing what it takes to get the bird off your head, you will avoid finding yourself saying, <b>\"If I get drunk, I won't be able to think about it.\"</b></p>\n<p class=\"p5\"><br></p>\n</body>\n</html>\n",

No matter how much you think you can control your feelings, no matter how well adjusted you think you are, no matter how well you like the 12 steps, every now and then something will happen that will upset you. The key is to not let that bird build a nest in your head. People, places, and things cannot control your emotions. They are just emotional triggers. Remember, you make yourself feel a certain way in response to the trigger. You can also quickly change how you respond.</p>\n<p class=\"p4\"><br></p>\n<p class=\"p3\"><span class=\"Apple-tab-span\">\t</span>TO DO:<span class=\"Apple-converted-space\">  </span>What's a good way to get that bird to fly away? One way is to try to recognize your feeling, and then to try to change the bad feeling to a positive feeling. To do so, you can start by using this app. You can also ask yourself if the trigger is worth being upset about. You can also try applying the 12 steps to the feeling. First, admit that you are powerless to handle it alone. Then, turn the problem over to a Higher Power. That Higher Power may be a consultation with a sponsor, a therapist, or your God.<span class=\"Apple-converted-space\">  </span>Maybe take an inventory and see where your own sensitivity may be contributing to the problem. If you can determine what the character sensitivity or issue is, tell someone else. If you can't determine what it is, discuss the situation with someone else. Try to find<span class=\"Apple-converted-space\">  </span><span class=\"s1\">your </span>defect and not the defect in the person you think is causing the problem. Once you find the defect, ask God to remove it.</p>\n<p class=\"p3\"><span class=\"Apple-tab-span\">\t</span>If the problem causes resentment, pray for the person who you think is causing the resentment.<span class=\"Apple-converted-space\"> </span></p>\n<p class=\"p3\"><span class=\"Apple-tab-span\">\t</span><span class=\"Apple-converted-space\">    </span>Remember to ask God that His will be done, not yours.

You may gain perspective. Your attention will be re-focused.<span class=\"Apple-converted-space\">  </span>By doing what it takes to get the bird off your head, you will avoid finding yourself saying, <b>\"If I get drunk, I won't be able to think about it.\"</b></p>\n<p class=\"p5\"><br></p>\n</body>\n</html>\n",

Is that your addict voice or is that your recovery voice?<span class=\"Apple-converted-space\">  </span>Because addiction is a chronic disease, we will always have an addict voice. The key to keeping it in remission is to substitute the messages our addict voice gives us with the messages our recovery voice learns at 12 step meetings and in therapy. Your addict voice will speak to you in your style of speech in an attractive, encouraging voice. It will try to get you to use. It will try to persuade you in a way only you can understand to use \"just one\" or to not go to a meeting or to not do your morning ritual because you are too busy. It will try to tell you you're cured so you can have just one. A key to sobriety is recognizing and doing the opposite of that voice. Your addict voice causes you fear and stress. It takes a personality change to keep the addict voice quiet.</p>\n<p class=\"p2\"><br></p>\n<p class=\"p1\">To Do: Listen to the addict voice as you go through your day and substitute its advice with your recovery voice. Connect to your Higher Power and ask his help to change voices. This will keep you sober and at peace. Good for you for using this App to change voices!</p>\n<p class=\"p3\"><br></p>\n</body>\n</html>\n",

Always test your first thought by thinking of its consequences (good and bad) and always think of possible alternative thoughts before you act.

For example, usually our first thought when confronted with stress, anger or some other negative emotion is to lash out, withdraw, or escape by picking up our first drug of choice. This just causes more conflict, stress, anger and resentment. We consequently regret acting upon our first thoughts. Acting upon our first thought is called a <i>reaction.<span class=\"Apple-converted-space\">  </span></i>In recovery, we learn to \"act upon\", not react, and this makes our lives easier.

You probably will forget what's troubling you, but you probably won't forget if you let the symptoms of depression make you drink, eat, drug, spend hours on the internet, ruin your sleep, make you lose interest in things you used to enjoy, and otherwise ruin your day. Most times, it is the initial shock that hurts when we are confronted with an issue. Often, it is a little thing that starts us spiraling downward. It is important to not \"sweat the small stuff\". It is important to nip bad feelings in the bud.  </p>\n<p class=\"p3\">           <span class=\"Apple-converted-space\"> </span></p>\n<p class=\"p3\">           TO DO: You should use a <b>recovery tool</b> to get over the shock and forget what's bothering you, like sharing the problem with a friend, going to a meeting, journaling, deep breathing and more. Writing down something that bothers you and throwing it in the trash might help. Don't sweep your problems under the rug, deal with them one at a time. But there is a time to forget about them. Writing down 5 things you are grateful for (like being able to walk, living in a safe place, having food, etc.) may change your attitude.</p>\n<p class=\"p2\"><br></p>\n<p class=\"p4\"><br></p>\n</body>\n</html>\n",

When you reach bottom, you have become like a tightly wound baseball. If you've never seen the inside of a baseball, it is tightly wound around a tiny rock hard center. You are like that baseball in that you have layer after layer of fears and resentments that are strangling your core (your true self). Your core can deal with reality; but your addiction consists of the layers of fears and resentments which make your core impotent. Once you cut through those layers by doing the 12 steps (particularly 4-7 and a daily 10<sup>th</sup>), you will free your core.<span class=\"Apple-converted-space\">  </span>And you will find that your core is this joyous being that can deal quite happily with reality without drugs.</p>\n<p class=\"p2\"><br></p>\n<p class=\"p4\">TO DO: Don't let your core strangle. Keep going to meetings and practicing \"these principles in all our affairs.\" Do a fourth step, a \"searching and fearless\" moral inventory to discover all your fears and resentments which are strangling your wonderful core. Then do a fifth step by admitting those fears and resentments to yourself, your Higher Power, and another trusted human being. This will free your core. And remember to do this process on a daily basis (the 10<sup>th</sup> step), so that you can keep your core free when new fears and resentments creep back into your life.</p>\n</body>\n</html>\n",

For example, watch out for the 13<sup>th</sup> step (trying to pick up members of the opposite sex at meetings). Perhaps nothing can throw a newly recovering addict out of balance more than the emotional vicissitudes of a new sexual relationship. Accordingly, an adage heard at meetings is \" no new relationships for the first year.\"</p>\n<p class=\"p3\">TO DO: Focus on keeping an emotional \"even keel\". If you are tempted to act out sexually or to start a new relationship, ask yourself if it is worth your sobriety?</p>\n<p class=\"p4\"><br></p>\n</body>\n</html>\n",

Is that your addict voice or is that your recovery voice?<span class=\"Apple-converted-space\">  </span>Because addiction is a chronic disease, we will always have an addict voice. The key to keeping it in remission is to substitute the messages our addict voice gives us with the messages our recovery voice learns at 12 step meetings and in therapy. Your addict voice will speak to you in your style of speech in an attractive, encouraging voice. It will try to get you to use. It will try to persuade you in a way only you can understand to use \"just one\" or to not go to a meeting or to not do your morning ritual because you are too busy. It will try to tell you you're cured so you can have just one. A key to sobriety is recognizing and doing the opposite of that voice. Your addict voice causes you fear and stress. It takes a personality change to keep the addict voice quiet.</p>\n<p class=\"p2\"><br></p>\n<p class=\"p1\">To Do: Listen to the addict voice as you go through your day and substitute its advice with your recovery voice. Connect to your Higher Power and ask his help to change voices. This will keep you sober and at peace.

Without such a program, life's frustrations and temptations cannot be managed.

If you have accepted that you have addiction, you need help from a Higher Power. Higher Power means a power greater than yourself. At first, that may be treatment. Then, it may be AA meetings. Then, it may evolve to something else. But if you trust your own damaged brain to lead the treatment, you are not making sense.

No matter how much you think you can control your feelings, no matter how well adjusted you think you are, no matter how well you like the 12 steps, every now and then something will happen that will upset you. The key is to not let that bird build a nest in your head. People, places, and things cannot control your emotions. They are just emotional triggers. Remember, you make yourself feel a certain way in response to the trigger. You can also quickly change how you respond.</p>\n<p class=\"p4\"><br></p>\n<p class=\"p3\"><span class=\"Apple-tab-span\">\t</span>TO DO:<span class=\"Apple-converted-space\">  </span>What's a good way to get that bird to fly away? One way is to try to recognize your feeling, and then to try to change the bad feeling to a positive feeling. To do so, you can start by using this app. You can also ask yourself if the trigger is worth being upset about. You can also try applying the 12 steps to the feeling. First, admit that you are powerless to handle it alone. Then, turn the problem over to a Higher Power. That Higher Power may be a consultation with a sponsor, a therapist, or your God.<span class=\"Apple-converted-space\">  </span>Maybe take an inventory and see where your own sensitivity may be contributing to the problem. If you can determine what the character sensitivity or issue is, tell someone else. If you can't determine what it is, discuss the situation with someone else. Try to find<span class=\"Apple-converted-space\">  </span><span class=\"s1\">your </span>defect and not the defect in the person you think is causing the problem. Once you find the defect, ask God to remove it.</p>\n<p class=\"p3\"><span class=\"Apple-tab-span\">\t</span>If the problem causes resentment, pray for the person who you think is causing the resentment.<span class=\"Apple-converted-space\"> </span></p>\n<p class=\"p3\"><span class=\"Apple-tab-span\">\t</span><span class=\"Apple-converted-space\">    </span>Remember to ask God that His will be done, not yours. And most importantly, try to help someone who is new to recovery. By getting out of yourself and helping another, you may be grateful that your problem is not as bad as the other person. You may gain perspective. Your attention will be re-focused.<span class=\"Apple-converted-space\">  </span>By doing what it takes to get the bird off your head, you will avoid finding yourself saying, <b>\"If I get drunk, I won't be able to think about it.\"</b></p>\n<p class=\"p5\"><br></p>\n</body>\n</html>\n",

Addicts tend to be control freaks. We think we know what's right and how to do it and what everyone else should do. We want to run the show. Often with the best of intentions, we tell people what to do. The only problem is that we forget that they usually don't want to hear what we have to say- especially if we are newly sober because we have made such a mess out of our own lives that we have nothing to back up what we are saying.</p>\n<p class=\"p3\"><span class=\"Apple-tab-span\">\t</span>The twelve steps teach us that we are not in charge- that everyone (including ourselves) is much better off if we turn our control over to our Higher Power.<span class=\"Apple-converted-space\">  </span>Usually, this means that we just try to do what's in front of us without controlling people, places or things. Rather, we should just accept what is and remember everything is not about us or our way.</p>\n<p class=\"p3\"><span class=\"Apple-tab-span\">\t</span>Getting out of the way means letting go of our need to control things we cannot. This keeps us from picking up the first drink because we lose the frustration that comes with doing the impossible.

A good way to relax is to ask yourself if you really are in trouble or is it just your anxious brain talking? Addicts overanalyze. We worry about outcomes. We try to control what we cannot. We tend to think negatively. We tend to ignore good things, and dwell on bad things. Addicts use and act out to try to change their irritating brains. Unfortunately, substances and addictive behaviors not only change our brains but cause us to break laws, end up in hospitals, lose God, and ruin relationships. A better way to change our brains is to surround ourselves with recovering people who care about us, exercise, eat correctly, practice the 12 steps, and share our secrets with Sponsors.</p>\n<p class=\"p2\"><br></p>\n<p class=\"p1\">To Do: Tell yourself to stop thinking. Get out of your head and into your heart. Instead reach out to help someone or do something to serve your Higher Power. Sometimes that service can be not making a problem worse or just taking a break for a peaceful walk or some other fun activity.</p>\n<p class=\"p2\"><br></p>\n<p class=\"p3\"><br></p>\n</body>\n</html>\n",

The problem with anger according to most of my patients is that \"it comes on so suddenly\". This is why daily practice to deal with anger is so critical. First, a third step prayer to start the day is essential to align one's will with God's will. This alignment removes stress induced by our small minded, egotistically imbalanced desires. Second, throughout the day, taking breaks every three hours to breathe slowly reduce the stress associated with living life like an overwhelmed juggernaut. These breathing breaks should be done before anger sets in and even on peaceful days. This proactive methodology (daily 3<sup>rd</sup> step prayer and breathing breaks) must become a habit. If anger starts, pick up the phone and share the cause with a safe person (Sponsor, friend, therapist) as soon as possible. The more anger builds, the more harm it can do to you and your relationships. Finally, as a last resort, always have an anger escape plan. For many of my patients, it's removal from the situation (\"I need to go to the restroom\", \"I need to make a call\"). If venting is necessary, a good place to do so includes yelling in one's parked car. Better to be slightly embarrassed by having to leave suddenly than to let anger dictate behavior which may be irreparable.</p>\n<p class=\"p2\"><br></p>\n<p class=\"p1\">To Do: Deal with anger proactively even if you are not angry. Share your anger with a safe person. Get anger out in safe ways.<span class=\"Apple-converted-space\"> </span></p>\n<p class=\"p2\"><br></p>\n<p class=\"p3\"><br></p>\n</body>\n</html>\n",

If you've never seen the inside of a baseball, it is tightly wound around a tiny rock hard center. You are like that baseball in that you have layer after layer of fears and resentments that are strangling your core (your true self). Your core can deal with reality; but your addiction consists of the layers of fears and resentments which make your core impotent. Once you cut through those layers by doing the 12 steps (particularly 4-7 and a daily 10<sup>th</sup>), you will free your core.<span class=\"Apple-converted-space\">  </span>And you will find that your core is this joyous being that can deal quite happily with reality without drugs.</p>\n<p class=\"p2\"><br></p>\n<p class=\"p4\">TO DO: Don't let your core strangle. Keep the faith. Do a fourth step, a \"searching and fearless\" moral inventory to discover all your fears and resentments which are strangling your wonderful core. Then do a fifth step by admitting those fears and resentments to yourself, your Higher Power, and another trusted human being. This will free your core. And remember to do this process on a daily basis (the 10<sup>th</sup> step), so that you can keep your core free when new fears and resentments creep back into your life.</p>\n</body>\n</html>\n",

No matter how much you think you can control your feelings, no matter how well adjusted you think you are, no matter how well you like the 12 steps, every now and then something will happen that will upset you. The key is to not let that bird build a nest in your head. People, places, and things cannot control your emotions. They are just emotional triggers. Remember, you make yourself feel a certain way in response to the trigger. You can also quickly change how you respond.</p>\n<p class=\"p4\"><br></p>\n<p class=\"p3\"><span class=\"Apple-tab-span\">\t</span>TO DO:<span class=\"Apple-converted-space\">  </span>What's a good way to get that bird to fly away? One way is to try to recognize your feeling, and then to try to change the bad feeling to a positive feeling. To do so, you can start by using this app. You can also ask yourself if the trigger is worth being upset about. You can also try applying the 12 steps to the feeling. First, admit that you are powerless to handle it alone. Then, turn the problem over to a Higher Power. That Higher Power may be a consultation with a sponsor, a therapist, or your God.<span class=\"Apple-converted-space\">  </span>Maybe take an inventory and see where your own sensitivity may be contributing to the problem. If you can determine what the character sensitivity or issue is, tell someone else. If you can't determine what it is, discuss the situation with someone else. Try to find<span class=\"Apple-converted-space\">  </span><span class=\"s1\">your </span>defect and not the defect in the person you think is causing the problem. Once you find the defect, ask God to remove it. This takes faith.</p>\n<p class=\"p3\"><span class=\"Apple-tab-span\">\t</span>If the problem causes resentment, pray for the person who you think is causing the resentment.<span class=\"Apple-converted-space\"> </span></p>\n<p class=\"p3\"><span class=\"Apple-tab-span\">\t</span><span class=\"Apple-converted-space\">    </span>Remember to ask God that His will be done, not yours.

You may gain perspective. Your attention will be re-focused.<span class=\"Apple-converted-space\">  </span>By doing what it takes to get the bird off your head, you will avoid finding yourself saying, <b>\"If I get drunk, I won't be able to think about it.\"</b></p>\n<p class=\"p5\"><br></p>\n</body>\n</html>\n",

We tried to appear as if we knew it all, were totally in control, and were all powerful. But inside we knew differently so we escaped by using. The truth is that others knew we were frauds too. We ended up humiliated. In recovery, we turn this humiliation into humility. We recognize that we can accept ourselves even though we are not as important as we thought we had to be.

In fact, things NEVER work out exactly as planned. So, if you are thinking life is not fair or life doesn't make sense and that this is a good reason to use, then you are not being entirely realistic. You are asking for more than what life can give you. It's OK to make plans, but you can't be God so you can't control the results. Trying to control results and people causes frustration, anger, fear, and resentment.</p>\n<p class=\"p4\"><br></p>\n<p class=\"p3\">TO DO: To feel better, have faith that your loving Higher Power has a better plan for you; it's just that you may not be able to see it yet. Remember your concept of God does not have to be a traditional, religious concept (although it can be); God can be any positive, healthy force you want that helps return you to sanity.</p>\n<p class=\"p4\"><br></p>\n<p class=\"p4\"><br></p>\n<p class=\"p4\"><br></p>\n<p class=\"p5\"><br></p>\n</body>\n</html>\n",

If you are unsure of whether or not you are an addict, don't automatically deny that you are. Rather, give treatment a chance and see if your life is easier (with less bad consequences) when you are not using. If you are confused about whether or not you can have a Higher Power, remember that you don't have to have a perfect idea of one. Many addicts use the group as a Higher Power. Ask yourself whether or not your drug of choice had become a harmful Higher Power and whether or not it's time to pick a healing Higher Power. If you think you know how to stay sober on your own, you probably have a lot to learn, particularly if you have tried to stop using on your own before. So get to treatment and a meeting. If you think you are going to make the perfect decision with results that will work out exactly as planned, you have a lot to learn.<span class=\"Apple-converted-space\"> </span></p>\n<p class=\"p2\"><br></p>\n<p class=\"p1\">To Do: It's time to let go of knowing everything.

Is that your addict voice or is that your recovery voice?<span class=\"Apple-converted-space\">  </span>Because addiction is a chronic disease, we will always have an addict voice. The key to keeping it in remission is to substitute the messages our addict voice gives us with the messages our recovery voice learns at 12 step meetings and in therapy. Your addict voice will speak to you in your style of speech in an attractive, encouraging voice. It will try to get you to use. It will try to persuade you in a way only you can understand to use \"just one\" or to not go to a meeting or to not do your morning ritual because you are too busy. It will try to tell you you're cured so you can have just one. A key to sobriety is recognizing and doing the opposite of that voice. Your addict voice causes you fear and stress. It takes a personality change to keep the addict voice quiet.</p>\n<p class=\"p2\"><br></p>\n<p class=\"p1\">To Do: Listen to the addict voice as you go through your day and substitute its advice with your recovery voice. Connect to your Higher Power and ask his help to change voices. This will keep you sober and at peace. Good for you for using this App to change voices!</p>\n<p class=\"p3\"><br></p>\n</body>\n</html>\n",

You are like that baseball in that you have layer after layer of fears and resentments that are strangling your core (your true self). Your core can deal with reality; but your addiction consists of the layers of fears and resentments which make your core impotent. Once you cut through those layers by doing the 12 steps (particularly 4-7 and a daily 10<sup>th</sup>), you will free your core.<span class=\"Apple-converted-space\">  </span>And you will find that your core is this joyous being that can deal quite happily with reality without drugs.</p>\n<p class=\"p2\"><br></p>\n<p class=\"p4\">TO DO: Don't let your core strangle. Do a fourth step, a \"searching and fearless\" moral inventory to discover all your fears and resentments which are strangling your wonderful core. Then do a fifth step by admitting those fears and resentments to yourself, your Higher Power, and another trusted human being. This will free your core. And remember to do this process on a daily basis (the 10<sup>th</sup> step), so that you can keep your core free when new fears and resentments creep back into your life.</p>\n</body>\n</html>\n",

The only problem is that we forget that they usually don't want to hear what we have to say- especially if we are newly sober because we have made such a mess out of our own lives that we have nothing to back up what we are saying.</p>\n<p class=\"p3\"><span class=\"Apple-tab-span\">\t</span>The twelve steps teach us that we are not in charge- that everyone (including ourselves) is much better off if we turn our control over to our Higher Power.<span class=\"Apple-converted-space\">  </span>Usually, this means that we just try to do what's in front of us without controlling people, places or things. Rather, we should just accept what is and remember everything is not about us or our way.</p>\n<p class=\"p3\"><span class=\"Apple-tab-span\">\t</span>Getting out of the way means letting go of our need to control things we cannot. This keeps us from picking up the first drink because we lose the frustration that comes with doing the impossible. We can then accept life without drinking to escape from not getting our way.</p>\n<p class=\"p4\"><span class=\"Apple-tab-span\">\t</span></p>\n<p class=\"p3\">TO DO: Say to yourself: I will get out of the way and let my Higher Power handle the results.<span class=\"Apple-converted-space\"> </span></p>\n<p class=\"p4\"><br></p>\n<p class=\"p5\"><br></p>\n</body>\n</html>\n",

Learning is easier than faking knowing. Our addiction is tied to trying to look important. We drank and used because our egos wanted us to be more than what we were willing to accept. We had to put on facades, fake fronts to try to impress others. We tried to appear as if we knew it all, were totally in control, and were all powerful. But inside we knew differently so we escaped by using. The truth is that others knew we were frauds too. We ended up humiliated. In recovery, we turn this humiliation into humility. We recognize that we can accept ourselves even though we are not as important as we thought we had to be. We learn to appreciate ourselves for who we are, not some egomaniacal version of who we would like to be and who we would like others to think we are. We become openminded to learning, and this actually makes us feel better.<span class=\"Apple-converted-space\"> </span></p>\n<p class=\"p2\"><br></p>\n<p class=\"p1\">To Do: Ask someone for help, and follow their suggestion. Exercising humility will bring us closer to our personal Higher Power which will keep us sober and remove our self defeating behaviors.</p>\n<p class=\"p2\"><br></p>\n<p class=\"p3\"><br></p>\n</body>\n</html>\n",

How do we move away from our Higher Power?<span class=\"Apple-converted-space\">  </span>We do or think things that disconnect us from God. For example, disconnected thinking involves worry, resentment, fear, compulsivity, hate, anger, etc. Disconnected behaviors involve \" immature\" acting, sexual deviance, misrepresentations, physical abuse, verbal abuse, relapse, etc.<span class=\"Apple-tab-span\">\t</span></p>\n<p class=\"p3\"><span class=\"Apple-tab-span\">\t</span>It is challenging to stay spiritually connected if you stay surrounded by spiritual doubters so go to meetings to be around spiritual believers.</p>\n<p class=\"p4\"><br></p>\n<p class=\"p3\">TO DO: Ask God how you can do what God wants. Begin by doing honest, pure, unselfish, loving acts. Find people, places, and things that connect you to God. Keep reconnecting throughout this day by catching yourself when you are doing and thinking in a \"disconnected\" way. Steps 8 and 9 often apply to clear your conscious or to right a relationship.

A good way to relax is to ask yourself if you really are in trouble or is it just your anxious brain talking? Addicts overanalyze. We worry about outcomes. We try to control what we cannot. We tend to think negatively. We tend to ignore good things, and dwell on bad things. Addicts use and act out to try to change their irritating brains. Unfortunately, substances and addictive behaviors not only change our brains but cause us to break laws, end up in hospitals, lose God, and ruin relationships. A better way to change our brains is to surround ourselves with recovering people who care about us, exercise, eat correctly, practice the 12 steps, and share our secrets with Sponsors.</p>\n<p class=\"p2\"><br></p>\n<p class=\"p1\">To Do: Tell yourself to stop thinking. Get out of your head and into your heart. Instead reach out to help someone or do something to serve your Higher Power. Sometimes that service can be not making a problem worse or just taking a break for a peaceful walk or some other fun activity.</p>\n<p class=\"p2\"><br></p>\n<p class=\"p3\"><br></p>\n</body>\n</html>\n",

How do we move away from our Higher Power?<span class=\"Apple-converted-space\">  </span>We do or think things that disconnect us from God. For example, disconnected thinking involves worry, resentment, fear, compulsivity, hate, anger, etc. Disconnected behaviors involve \" immature\" acting, sexual deviance, misrepresentations, physical abuse, verbal abuse, relapse, etc.<span class=\"Apple-tab-span\">\t</span></p>\n<p class=\"p3\"><span class=\"Apple-tab-span\">\t</span>It is challenging to stay spiritually connected if you stay surrounded by spiritual doubters so go to meetings to be around spiritual believers.

Begin by doing honest, pure, unselfish, loving acts. Find people, places, and things that connect you to God. Keep reconnecting throughout this day by catching yourself when you are doing and thinking in a \"disconnected\" way. Steps 8 and 9 often apply to clear your conscious or to right a relationship.

Learning is easier than faking knowing. Our addiction is tied to trying to look important. We drank and used because our egos wanted us to be more than what we were willing to accept. We had to put on facades, fake fronts to try to impress others. We tried to appear as if we knew it all, were totally in control, and were all powerful. But inside we knew differently so we escaped by using. The truth is that others knew we were frauds too. We ended up humiliated. In recovery, we turn this humiliation into humility. We recognize that we can accept ourselves even though we are not as important as we thought we had to be. We learn to appreciate ourselves for who we are, not some egomaniacal version of who we would like to be and who we would like others to think we are.

You are like that baseball in that you have layer after layer of fears and resentments that are strangling your core (your true self). Your core can deal with reality; but your addiction consists of the layers of fears and resentments which make your core impotent. Once you cut through those layers by doing the 12 steps (particularly 4-7 and a daily 10<sup>th</sup>), you will free your core.<span class=\"Apple-converted-space\">  </span>And you will find that your core is this joyous being that can deal quite happily with reality without drugs.</p>\n<p class=\"p2\"><br></p>\n<p class=\"p4\">TO DO: Don't let your core strangle. Do a fourth step, a \"searching and fearless\" moral inventory to discover all your fears and resentments which are strangling your wonderful core. Then do a fifth step by admitting those fears and resentments to yourself, your Higher Power, and another trusted human being. This will free your core. And remember to do this process on a daily basis (the 10<sup>th</sup> step), so that you can keep your core free when new fears and resentments creep back into your life.</p>\n</body>\n</html>\n",

No matter how much you think you can control your feelings, no matter how well adjusted you think you are, no matter how well you like the 12 steps, every now and then something will happen that will upset you. The key is to not let that bird build a nest in your head. People, places, and things cannot control your emotions. They are just emotional triggers. Remember, you make yourself feel a certain way in response to the trigger. You can also quickly change how you respond.</p>\n<p class=\"p4\"><br></p>\n<p class=\"p3\"><span class=\"Apple-tab-span\">\t</span>TO DO:<span class=\"Apple-converted-space\">  </span>What's a good way to get that bird to fly away? One way is to try to recognize your feeling, and then to try to change the bad feeling to a positive feeling. To do so, you can start by using this app. You can also ask yourself if the trigger is worth being upset about. You can also try applying the 12 steps to the feeling. First, admit that you are powerless to handle it alone. Then, turn the problem over to a Higher Power. That Higher Power may be a consultation with a sponsor, a therapist, or your God.<span class=\"Apple-converted-space\">  </span>Maybe take an inventory and see where your own sensitivity may be contributing to the problem. If you can determine what the character sensitivity or issue is, tell someone else. If you can't determine what it is, discuss the situation with someone else. Try to find<span class=\"Apple-converted-space\">  </span><span class=\"s1\">your </span>defect and not the defect in the person you think is causing the problem. Once you find the defect, ask God to remove it.</p>\n<p class=\"p3\"><span class=\"Apple-tab-span\">\t</span>If the problem causes resentment, pray for the person who you think is causing the resentment.<span class=\"Apple-converted-space\"> </span></p>\n<p class=\"p3\"><span class=\"Apple-tab-span\">\t</span><span class=\"Apple-converted-space\">    </span>Remember to ask God that His will be done, not yours. And most importantly, try to help someone who is new to recovery. By getting out of yourself and helping another, you may be grateful that your problem is not as bad as the other person. You may gain perspective. Your attention will be re-focused.<span class=\"Apple-converted-space\">  </span>By doing what it takes to get the bird off your head, you will avoid finding yourself saying, <b>\"If I get drunk, I won't be able to think about it.\"</b></p>\n<p class=\"p5\"><br></p>\n</body>\n</html>\n",

Always test your first thought by thinking of its consequences (good and bad) and always think of possible alternative thoughts before you act.

This just causes more conflict, stress, anger and resentment. We consequently regret acting upon our first thoughts.

The problem with anger according to most of my patients is that \"it comes on so suddenly\". This is why daily practice to deal with anger is so critical. First, a third step prayer to start the day is essential to align one's will with God's will. This alignment removes stress induced by our small minded, egotistically imbalanced desires. Second, throughout the day, taking breaks every three hours to breathe slowly reduce the stress associated with living life like an overwhelmed juggernaut. These breathing breaks should be done before anger sets in and even on peaceful days. This proactive methodology (daily 3<sup>rd</sup> step prayer and breathing breaks) must become a habit. If anger starts, pick up the phone and share the cause with a safe person (Sponsor, friend, therapist) as soon as possible. The more anger builds, the more harm it can do to you and your relationships. Finally, as a last resort, always have an anger escape plan. For many of my patients, it's removal from the situation (\"I need to go to the restroom\", \"I need to make a call\"). If venting is necessary, a good place to do so includes yelling in one's parked car. Better to be slightly embarrassed by having to leave suddenly than to let anger dictate behavior which may be irreparable.</p>\n<p class=\"p2\"><br></p>\n<p class=\"p1\">To Do: Deal with anger proactively even if you are not angry. Share your anger with a safe person. Get anger out in safe ways.<span class=\"Apple-converted-space\"> </span></p>\n<p class=\"p2\"><br></p>\n<p class=\"p3\"><br></p>\n</body>\n</html>\n",

I was immediately angry at him. Instead of letting that anger build and ruin my day, I thought of reasons to be grateful for him. I remembered the great idea he came up with to save me money. I remembered how supportive he had been over the years. As I consciously told myself of reasons to be grateful for him, my anger dissipated and I actually relaxed and felt happy. <b>If you can't think of a reason to be grateful for something that the offending person did for you, focus on the fact that the person has given you the opportunity to practice good character attributes like patience and forgiveness and understanding. </b>This practice will help improve your personality and make it easier the next time someone interferes with your rights.</p>\n<p class=\"p2\">To Do: Has any family member caused you resentment or are you angry at someone? Think of something you are grateful for about that person, even if it's just that you he has given you an opportunity to grow. You are doing great by switching your attitude. Good for you!</p>\n</body>\n</html>\n",

A good way to relax is to ask yourself if you really are in trouble or is it just your anxious brain talking? Addicts overanalyze. We worry about outcomes. We try to control what we cannot. We tend to think negatively. We tend to ignore good things, and dwell on bad things. Addicts use and act out to try to change their irritating brains. Unfortunately, substances and addictive behaviors not only change our brains but cause us to break laws, end up in hospitals, lose God, and ruin relationships. A better way to change our brains is to surround ourselves with recovering people who care about us, exercise, eat correctly, practice the 12 steps, and share our secrets with Sponsors.</p>\n<p class=\"p2\"><br></p>\n<p class=\"p1\">To Do: Tell yourself to stop thinking. Get out of your head and into your heart. Instead reach out to help someone or do something to serve your Higher Power. Sometimes that service can be not making a problem worse or just taking a break for a peaceful walk or some other fun activity.</p>\n<p class=\"p2\"><br></p>\n<p class=\"p3\"><br></p>\n</body>\n</html>\n",

Sobriety requires us to focus less about ourselves and our rights. Sobriety asks us to just deal positively with the experience.

Most times, it is the initial shock that hurts when we are confronted with an issue. Often, it is a little thing that starts us spiraling downward. It is important to not \"sweat the small stuff\". It is important to nip bad feelings in the bud.  </p>\n<p class=\"p3\">           <span class=\"Apple-converted-space\"> </span></p>\n<p class=\"p3\">           TO DO: You should use a <b>recovery tool</b> to get over the shock and forget what's bothering you, like sharing the problem with a friend, going to a meeting, journaling, deep breathing and more. Writing down something that bothers you and throwing it in the trash might help. Don't sweep your problems under the rug, deal with them one at a time. But there is a time to forget about them. Writing down 5 things you are grateful for (like being able to walk, living in a safe place, having food, etc.) may change your attitude.</p>\n<p class=\"p2\"><br></p>\n<p class=\"p4\"><br></p>\n</body>\n</html>\n",

Always test your first thought by thinking of its consequences (good and bad) and always think of possible alternative thoughts before you act. Especially with addicts, our first thoughts tend to be harmful to ourselves and others. For example, usually our first thought when confronted with stress, anger or some other negative emotion is to lash out, withdraw, or escape by picking up our first drug of choice. This just causes more conflict, stress, anger and resentment. We consequently regret acting upon our first thoughts. Acting upon our first thought is called a <i>reaction.<span class=\"Apple-converted-space\">  </span></i>In recovery, we learn to \"act upon\", not react, and this makes our lives easier. When our lives are easier, we don't want to act out to avoid life so we stay sober and we make better decisions.</p>\n<p class=\"p2\"><br></p>\n<p class=\"p1\"><span class=\"Apple-tab-span\">\t</span>To Do: Move on to the second thought.

We worry so much about what others think. A good way to relax is to ask yourself if you really are in trouble or is it just your anxious brain talking? Addicts overanalyze. We worry about outcomes. We try to control what we cannot. We tend to think negatively. We tend to ignore good things, and dwell on bad things. Addicts use and act out to try to change their irritating brains. Unfortunately, substances and addictive behaviors not only change our brains but cause us to break laws, end up in hospitals, lose God, and ruin relationships. A better way to change our brains is to surround ourselves with recovering people who care about us, exercise, eat correctly, practice the 12 steps, and share our secrets with Sponsors.</p>\n<p class=\"p2\"><br></p>\n<p class=\"p1\">To Do: Tell yourself to stop thinking. Get out of your head and into your heart. Instead reach out to help someone or do something to serve your Higher Power. Sometimes that service can be not making a problem worse or just taking a break for a peaceful walk or some other fun activity.</p>\n<p class=\"p2\"><br></p>\n<p class=\"p3\"><br></p>\n</body>\n</html>\n",

You probably will forget what's troubling you, but you probably won't forget if you let the symptoms of depression make you drink, eat, drug, spend hours on the internet, ruin your sleep, make you lose interest in things you used to enjoy, and otherwise ruin your day. Most times, it is the initial shock that hurts when we are confronted with an issue. Often, it is a little thing that starts us spiraling downward. It is important to not \"sweat the small stuff\". It is important to nip bad feelings in the bud.  </p>\n<p class=\"p3\">           <span class=\"Apple-converted-space\"> </span></p>\n<p class=\"p3\">           TO DO: You should use a <b>recovery tool</b> to get over the shock and forget what's bothering you, like sharing the problem with a friend, going to a meeting, journaling, deep breathing and more. Writing down something that bothers you and throwing it in the trash might help. Don't sweep your problems under the rug, deal with them one at a time. But there is a time to forget about them. Writing down 5 things you are grateful for (like being able to walk, living in a safe place, having food, etc.) may change your attitude.</p>\n<p class=\"p2\"><br></p>\n<p class=\"p4\"><br></p>\n</body>\n</html>\n",

If you've never seen the inside of a baseball, it is tightly wound around a tiny rock hard center. You are like that baseball in that you have layer after layer of fears and resentments that are strangling your core (your true self). Your core can deal with reality; but your addiction consists of the layers of fears and resentments which make your core impotent. Once you cut through those layers by doing the 12 steps (particularly 4-7 and a daily 10<sup>th</sup>), you will free your core.<span class=\"Apple-converted-space\">  </span>And you will find that your core is this joyous being that can deal quite happily with reality without drugs.</p>\n<p class=\"p2\"><br></p>\n<p class=\"p4\">TO DO: Don't let your core strangle. Do a fourth step, a \"searching and fearless\" moral inventory to discover all your fears and resentments which are strangling your wonderful core. Then do a fifth step by admitting those fears and resentments to yourself, your Higher Power, and another trusted human being. This will free your core. And remember to do this process on a daily basis (the 10<sup>th</sup> step), so that you can keep your core free when new fears and resentments creep back into your life.</p>\n</body>\n</html>\n",

No matter how much you think you can control your feelings, no matter how well adjusted you think you are, no matter how well you like the 12 steps, every now and then something will happen that will upset you. The key is to not let that bird build a nest in your head. People, places, and things cannot control your emotions. They are just emotional triggers. Remember, you make yourself feel a certain way in response to the trigger. You can also quickly change how you respond.</p>\n<p class=\"p4\"><br></p>\n<p class=\"p3\"><span class=\"Apple-tab-span\">\t</span>TO DO:<span class=\"Apple-converted-space\">  </span>What's a good way to get that bird to fly away? One way is to try to recognize your feeling, and then to try to change the bad feeling to a positive feeling. To do so, you can start by using this app. You can also ask yourself if the trigger is worth being upset about. You can also try applying the 12 steps to the feeling. First, admit that you are powerless to handle it alone. Then, turn the problem over to a Higher Power. That Higher Power may be a consultation with a sponsor, a therapist, or your God.<span class=\"Apple-converted-space\">  </span>Maybe take an inventory and see where your own sensitivity may be contributing to the problem. If you can determine what the character sensitivity or issue is, tell someone else. If you can't determine what it is, discuss the situation with someone else. Try to find<span class=\"Apple-converted-space\">  </span><span class=\"s1\">your </span>defect and not the defect in the person you think is causing the problem. Once you find the defect, ask God to remove it.</p>\n<p class=\"p3\"><span class=\"Apple-tab-span\">\t</span>If the problem causes resentment, pray for the person who you think is causing the resentment.<span class=\"Apple-converted-space\"> </span></p>\n<p class=\"p3\"><span class=\"Apple-tab-span\">\t</span><span class=\"Apple-converted-space\">    </span>Remember to ask God that His will be done, not yours.

You may gain perspective. Your attention will be re-focused.<span class=\"Apple-converted-space\">  </span>By doing what it takes to get the bird off your head, you will avoid finding yourself saying, <b>\"If I get drunk, I won't be able to think about it.\"</b></p>\n<p class=\"p5\"><br></p>\n</body>\n</html>\n",

A good way to relax is to ask yourself if you really are in trouble or is it just your anxious brain talking? Addicts overanalyze. We worry about outcomes. We try to control what we cannot. We tend to think negatively. We tend to ignore good things, and dwell on bad things. Addicts use and act out to try to change their irritating brains. Unfortunately, substances and addictive behaviors not only change our brains but cause us to break laws, end up in hospitals, lose God, and ruin relationships. A better way to change our brains is to surround ourselves with recovering people who care about us, exercise, eat correctly, practice the 12 steps, and share our secrets with Sponsors.</p>\n<p class=\"p2\"><br></p>\n<p class=\"p1\">To Do: Tell yourself to stop thinking. Get out of your head and into your heart. Instead reach out to help someone or do something to serve your Higher Power. Sometimes that service can be not making a problem worse or just taking a break for a peaceful walk or some other fun activity.</p>\n<p class=\"p2\"><br></p>\n<p class=\"p3\"><br></p>\n</body>\n</html>\n",

Most times, it is the initial shock that hurts when we are confronted with an issue. Often, it is a little thing that starts us spiraling downward. It is important to not \"sweat the small stuff\". It is important to nip bad feelings in the bud.  </p>\n<p class=\"p3\">           <span class=\"Apple-converted-space\"> </span></p>\n<p class=\"p3\">           TO DO: You should use a <b>recovery tool</b> to get over the shock and forget what's bothering you, like sharing the problem with a friend, going to a meeting, journaling, deep breathing and more. Writing down something that bothers you and throwing it in the trash might help. Don't sweep your problems under the rug, deal with them one at a time. But there is a time to forget about them. Writing down 5 things you are grateful for (like being able to walk, living in a safe place, having food, etc.) may change your attitude.</p>\n<p class=\"p2\"><br></p>\n<p class=\"p4\"><br></p>\n</body>\n</html>\n",

No matter how much you think you can control your feelings, no matter how well adjusted you think you are, no matter how well you like the 12 steps, every now and then something will happen that will upset you. The key is to not let that bird build a nest in your head. People, places, and things cannot control your emotions. They are just emotional triggers. Remember, you make yourself feel a certain way in response to the trigger. You can also quickly change how you respond.</p>\n<p class=\"p4\"><br></p>\n<p class=\"p3\"><span class=\"Apple-tab-span\">\t</span>TO DO:<span class=\"Apple-converted-space\">  </span>What's a good way to get that bird to fly away? One way is to try to recognize your feeling, and then to try to change the bad feeling to a positive feeling. To do so, you can start by using this app. You can also ask yourself if the trigger is worth being upset about. You can also try applying the 12 steps to the feeling. First, admit that you are powerless to handle it alone. Then, turn the problem over to a Higher Power. That Higher Power may be a consultation with a sponsor, a therapist, or your God.<span class=\"Apple-converted-space\">  </span>Maybe take an inventory and see where your own sensitivity may be contributing to the problem. If you can determine what the character sensitivity or issue is, tell someone else. If you can't determine what it is, discuss the situation with someone else. Try to find<span class=\"Apple-converted-space\">  </span><span class=\"s1\">your </span>defect and not the defect in the person you think is causing the problem. Once you find the defect, ask God to remove it.</p>\n<p class=\"p3\"><span class=\"Apple-tab-span\">\t</span>If the problem causes resentment, pray for the person who you think is causing the resentment.<span class=\"Apple-converted-space\"> </span></p>\n<p class=\"p3\"><span class=\"Apple-tab-span\">\t</span><span class=\"Apple-converted-space\">    </span>Remember to ask God that His will be done, not yours. And most importantly, try to help someone who is new to recovery. By getting out of yourself and helping another, you may be grateful that your problem is not as bad as the other person. You may gain perspective. Your attention will be re-focused.<span class=\"Apple-converted-space\">  </span>By doing what it takes to get the bird off your head, you will avoid finding yourself saying, <b>\"If I get drunk, I won't be able to think about it.\"</b></p>\n<p class=\"p5\"><br></p>\n</body>\n</html>\n",

Always test your first thought by thinking of its consequences (good and bad) and always think of possible alternative thoughts before you act. Especially with addicts, our first thoughts tend to be harmful to ourselves and others. For example, usually our first thought when confronted with stress, anger or some other negative emotion is to lash out, withdraw, or escape by picking up our first drug of choice. This just causes more conflict, stress, anger and resentment. We consequently regret acting upon our first thoughts. Acting upon our first thought is called a <i>reaction.<span class=\"Apple-converted-space\">  </span></i>In recovery, we learn to \"act upon\", not react, and this makes our lives easier. When our lives are easier, we don't want to act out to avoid life so we stay sober and we make better decisions.</p>\n<p class=\"p2\"><br></p>\n<p class=\"p1\"><span class=\"Apple-tab-span\">\t</span>To Do: Move on to the second thought.

We try to control what we cannot. We tend to think negatively. We tend to ignore good things, and dwell on bad things. Addicts use and act out to try to change their irritating brains. Unfortunately, substances and addictive behaviors not only change our brains but cause us to break laws, end up in hospitals, lose God, and ruin relationships. A better way to change our brains is to surround ourselves with recovering people who care about us, exercise, eat correctly, practice the 12 steps, and share our secrets with Sponsors.</p>\n<p class=\"p2\"><br></p>\n<p class=\"p1\">To Do: Tell yourself to stop thinking. Get out of your head and into your heart. Instead reach out to help someone or do something to serve your Higher Power.

You probably will forget what's troubling you, but you probably won't forget if you let the symptoms of depression make you drink, eat, drug, spend hours on the internet, ruin your sleep, make you lose interest in things you used to enjoy, and otherwise ruin your day. Most times, it is the initial shock that hurts when we are confronted with an issue. Often, it is a little thing that starts us spiraling downward. It is important to not \"sweat the small stuff\". It is important to nip bad feelings in the bud.  </p>\n<p class=\"p3\">           <span class=\"Apple-converted-space\"> </span></p>\n<p class=\"p3\">           TO DO: You should use a <b>recovery tool</b> to get over the shock and forget what's bothering you, like sharing the problem with a friend, going to a meeting, journaling, deep breathing and more. Writing down something that bothers you and throwing it in the trash might help. Don't sweep your problems under the rug, deal with them one at a time. But there is a time to forget about them. Writing down 5 things you are grateful for (like being able to walk, living in a safe place, having food, etc.) may change your attitude.</p>\n<p class=\"p2\"><br></p>\n<p class=\"p4\"><br></p>\n</body>\n</html>\n",

Always test your first thought by thinking of its consequences (good and bad) and always think of possible alternative thoughts before you act. Especially with addicts, our first thoughts tend to be harmful to ourselves and others. For example, usually our first thought when confronted with stress, anger or some other negative emotion is to lash out, withdraw, or escape by picking up our first drug of choice. This just causes more conflict, stress, anger and resentment. We consequently regret acting upon our first thoughts. Acting upon our first thought is called a <i>reaction.<span class=\"Apple-converted-space\">  </span></i>In recovery, we learn to \"act upon\", not react, and this makes our lives easier.

Addicts tend to be control freaks. We think we know what's right and how to do it and what everyone else should do. We want to run the show. Often with the best of intentions, we tell people what to do. The only problem is that we forget that they usually don't want to hear what we have to say- especially if we are newly sober because we have made such a mess out of our own lives that we have nothing to back up what we are saying.</p>\n<p class=\"p3\"><span class=\"Apple-tab-span\">\t</span>The twelve steps teach us that we are not in charge- that everyone (including ourselves) is much better off if we turn our control over to our Higher Power.<span class=\"Apple-converted-space\">  </span>Usually, this means that we just try to do what's in front of us without controlling people, places or things.

A good way to relax is to ask yourself if you really are in trouble or is it just your anxious brain talking? Addicts overanalyze. We worry about outcomes. We try to control what we cannot. We tend to think negatively. We tend to ignore good things, and dwell on bad things. Addicts use and act out to try to change their irritating brains. Unfortunately, substances and addictive behaviors not only change our brains but cause us to break laws, end up in hospitals, lose God, and ruin relationships. A better way to change our brains is to surround ourselves with recovering people who care about us, exercise, eat correctly, practice the 12 steps, and share our secrets with Sponsors.</p>\n<p class=\"p2\"><br></p>\n<p class=\"p1\">To Do: Tell yourself to stop thinking. Get out of your head and into your heart. Instead reach out to help someone or do something to serve your Higher Power.

You probably will forget what's troubling you, but you probably won't forget if you let the symptoms of depression make you drink, eat, drug, spend hours on the internet, ruin your sleep, make you lose interest in things you used to enjoy, and otherwise ruin your day. Most times, it is the initial shock that hurts when we are confronted with an issue. Often, it is a little thing that starts us spiraling downward. It is important to not \"sweat the small stuff\". It is important to nip bad feelings in the bud.  </p>\n<p class=\"p3\">           <span class=\"Apple-converted-space\"> </span></p>\n<p class=\"p3\">           TO DO: You should use a <b>recovery tool</b> to get over the shock and forget what's bothering you, like sharing the problem with a friend, going to a meeting, journaling, deep breathing and more. Writing down something that bothers you and throwing it in the trash might help. Don't sweep your problems under the rug, deal with them one at a time. But there is a time to forget about them. Writing down 5 things you are grateful for (like being able to walk, living in a safe place, having food, etc.) may change your attitude.</p>\n<p class=\"p2\"><br></p>\n<p class=\"p4\"><br></p>\n</body>\n</html>\n",

Rather, give treatment a chance and see if your life is easier (with less bad consequences) when you are not using. If you are confused about whether or not you can have a Higher Power, remember that you don't have to have a perfect idea of one. Many addicts use the group as a Higher Power. Ask yourself whether or not your drug of choice had become a harmful Higher Power and whether or not it's time to pick a healing Higher Power. If you think you know how to stay sober on your own, you probably have a lot to learn, particularly if you have tried to stop using on your own before. So get to treatment and a meeting.

No matter how much you think you can control your feelings, no matter how well adjusted you think you are, no matter how well you like the 12 steps, every now and then something will happen that will upset you. The key is to not let that bird build a nest in your head. People, places, and things cannot control your emotions. They are just emotional triggers. Remember, you make yourself feel a certain way in response to the trigger. You can also quickly change how you respond.</p>\n<p class=\"p4\"><br></p>\n<p class=\"p3\"><span class=\"Apple-tab-span\">\t</span>TO DO:<span class=\"Apple-converted-space\">  </span>What's a good way to get that bird to fly away? One way is to try to recognize your feeling, and then to try to change the bad feeling to a positive feeling. To do so, you can start by using this app. You can also ask yourself if the trigger is worth being upset about. You can also try applying the 12 steps to the feeling. First, admit that you are powerless to handle it alone. Then, turn the problem over to a Higher Power. That Higher Power may be a consultation with a sponsor, a therapist, or your God.<span class=\"Apple-converted-space\">  </span>Maybe take an inventory and see where your own sensitivity may be contributing to the problem. If you can determine what the character sensitivity or issue is, tell someone else. If you can't determine what it is, discuss the situation with someone else. Try to find<span class=\"Apple-converted-space\">  </span><span class=\"s1\">your </span>defect and not the defect in the person you think is causing the problem. Once you find the defect, ask God to remove it.</p>\n<p class=\"p3\"><span class=\"Apple-tab-span\">\t</span>If the problem causes resentment, pray for the person who you think is causing the resentment.<span class=\"Apple-converted-space\"> </span></p>\n<p class=\"p3\"><span class=\"Apple-tab-span\">\t</span><span class=\"Apple-converted-space\">    </span>Remember to ask God that His will be done, not yours. And most importantly, try to help someone who is new to recovery. By getting out of yourself and helping another, you may be grateful that your problem is not as bad as the other person. You may gain perspective. Your attention will be re-focused.<span class=\"Apple-converted-space\">  </span>By doing what it takes to get the bird off your head, you will avoid finding yourself saying, <b>\"If I get drunk, I won't be able to think about it.\"</b></p>\n<p class=\"p5\"><br></p>\n</body>\n</html>\n",

Fight or flight does not work as well as compromise.</p>\n<p class=\"p2\">To Do: Imagine the shock is a snake. Most snakes are harmless. In any event, you don't need to run away or lash out at it. Just gently support your head and breathe slowly and the snake will be hypnotized. We can't do anything productive in shock. We must let it pass.

Always test your first thought by thinking of its consequences (good and bad) and always think of possible alternative thoughts before you act.

For example, usually our first thought when confronted with stress, anger or some other negative emotion is to lash out, withdraw, or escape by picking up our first drug of choice. This just causes more conflict, stress, anger and resentment. We consequently regret acting upon our first thoughts. Acting upon our first thought is called a <i>reaction.<span class=\"Apple-converted-space\">  </span></i>In recovery, we learn to \"act upon\", not react, and this makes our lives easier.

A good way to relax is to ask yourself if you really are in trouble or is it just your anxious brain talking? Addicts overanalyze. We worry about outcomes. We try to control what we cannot. We tend to think negatively. We tend to ignore good things, and dwell on bad things. Addicts use and act out to try to change their irritating brains. Unfortunately, substances and addictive behaviors not only change our brains but cause us to break laws, end up in hospitals, lose God, and ruin relationships. A better way to change our brains is to surround ourselves with recovering people who care about us, exercise, eat correctly, practice the 12 steps, and share our secrets with Sponsors.</p>\n<p class=\"p2\"><br></p>\n<p class=\"p1\">To Do: Tell yourself to stop thinking. Get out of your head and into your heart. Instead reach out to help someone or do something to serve your Higher Power. Sometimes that service can be not making a problem worse or just taking a break for a peaceful walk or some other fun activity.</p>\n<p class=\"p2\"><br></p>\n<p class=\"p3\"><br></p>\n</body>\n</html>\n",

Exercise mindfulness. Mindfulness means that you are slowly breathing and keeping your mind in the moment. Start by looking at your feet, squeezing your foot muscles, then slowly working your way upward. Take your time, breathing slowly. Once you have reached the top of your head, start noticing your surroundings. Then do your next daily activity, keeping your mind focused on what you are doing. Don't live in the future or the past.</p>\n<p class=\"p3\"><br></p>\n<p class=\"p4\"><br></p>\n</body>\n</html>\n",

It might be a good idea to start with step 4 to see what character defect is causing you to struggle. Then you might need to get rid of that defect by doing steps 5-7. Usually over controlling is a problem, so step 1 applies: powerlessness over people, places, and things.</p>\n<p class=\"p3\"><br></p>\n<p class=\"p4\">To Do: Live the steps and apply each step beginning with step one to specific issues.

Most times, it is the initial shock that hurts when we are confronted with an issue. Often, it is a little thing that starts us spiraling downward. It is important to not \"sweat the small stuff\". It is important to nip bad feelings in the bud.  </p>\n<p class=\"p3\">           <span class=\"Apple-converted-space\"> </span></p>\n<p class=\"p3\">           TO DO: You should use a <b>recovery tool</b> to get over the shock and forget what's bothering you, like sharing the problem with a friend, going to a meeting, journaling, deep breathing and more. Writing down something that bothers you and throwing it in the trash might help. Don't sweep your problems under the rug, deal with them one at a time. But there is a time to forget about them. Writing down 5 things you are grateful for (like being able to walk, living in a safe place, having food, etc.) may change your attitude.</p>\n<p class=\"p2\"><br></p>\n<p class=\"p4\"><br></p>\n</body>\n</html>\n",

Always test your first thought by thinking of its consequences (good and bad) and always think of possible alternative thoughts before you act.

Acting upon our first thought is called a <i>reaction.<span class=\"Apple-converted-space\">  </span></i>In recovery, we learn to \"act upon\", not react, and this makes our lives easier.

Always test your first thought by thinking of its consequences (good and bad) and always think of possible alternative thoughts before you act. Especially with addicts, our first thoughts tend to be harmful to ourselves and others. For example, usually our first thought when confronted with stress, anger or some other negative emotion is to lash out, withdraw, or escape by picking up our first drug of choice. We consequently regret acting upon our first thoughts. Acting upon our first thought is called a <i>reaction.<span class=\"Apple-converted-space\">  </span></i>In recovery, we learn to \"act upon\", not react, and this makes our lives easier. When our lives are easier, we don't want to act out to avoid life so we stay sober and we make better decisions.</p>\n<p class=\"p2\"><br></p>\n<p class=\"p1\"><span class=\"Apple-tab-span\">\t</span>To Do: Move on to the second thought.

A good way to relax is to ask yourself if you really are in trouble or is it just your anxious brain talking? Addicts overanalyze. We worry about outcomes. We try to control what we cannot. We tend to think negatively. We tend to think we are worthless if we make a mistake. We tend to ignore good things, and dwell on bad things. Addicts use and act out to try to change their irritating brains. Unfortunately, substances and addictive behaviors not only change our brains but cause us to break laws, end up in hospitals, lose God, and ruin relationships. A better way to change our brains is to surround ourselves with recovering people who care about us, exercise, eat correctly, practice the 12 steps, and share our secrets with Sponsors.</p>\n<p class=\"p2\"><br></p>\n<p class=\"p1\">To Do: Tell yourself to stop thinking. Get out of your head and into your heart. Instead reach out to help someone or do something to serve your Higher Power. Sometimes that service can be not making a problem worse or just taking a break for a peaceful walk or some other fun activity.</p>\n<p class=\"p2\"><br></p>\n<p class=\"p3\"><br></p>\n</body>\n</html>\n",

You are like that baseball in that you have layer after layer of fears and resentments that are strangling your core (your true self). Your core can deal with reality; but your addiction consists of the layers of fears and resentments which make your core impotent. Once you cut through those layers by doing the 12 steps (particularly 4-7 and a daily 10<sup>th</sup>), you will free your core.<span class=\"Apple-converted-space\">  </span>And you will find that your core is this joyous being that can deal quite happily with reality without drugs.</p>\n<p class=\"p2\"><br></p>\n<p class=\"p4\">TO DO: Don't let your core strangle. Do a fourth step, a \"searching and fearless\" moral inventory to discover all your fears and resentments which are strangling your wonderful core. Then do a fifth step by admitting those fears and resentments to yourself, your Higher Power, and another trusted human being. This will free your core. And remember to do this process on a daily basis (the 10<sup>th</sup> step), so that you can keep your core free when new fears and resentments creep back into your life.</p>\n</body>\n</html>\n",

Is that your addict voice or is that your recovery voice?<span class=\"Apple-converted-space\">  </span>Because addiction is a chronic disease, we will always have an addict voice. The key to keeping it in remission is to substitute the messages our addict voice gives us with the messages our recovery voice learns at 12 step meetings and in therapy. Your addict voice will speak to you in your style of speech in an attractive, encouraging voice. It will try to get you to use. It will try to persuade you in a way only you can understand to use \"just one\" or to not go to a meeting or to not do your morning ritual because you are too busy. It will try to tell you you're cured so you can have just one. A key to sobriety is recognizing and doing the opposite of that voice. Your addict voice causes you fear and stress. It takes a personality change to keep the addict voice quiet.</p>\n<p class=\"p2\"><br></p>\n<p class=\"p1\">To Do: Listen to the addict voice as you go through your day and substitute its advice with your recovery voice. Connect to your Higher Power and ask his help to change voices. This will keep you sober and at peace. Good for you for using this App to change voices!</p>\n<p class=\"p3\"><br></p>\n</body>\n</html>\n",

I must combine my change of thinking with a new action whenever I begin to feel resentment. That new action may be praying for the person I resent to heal. It may be doing something else positive for my life so that I don't think about the resentment. It may be forgiving the person.</p>\n<p class=\"p2\"><br></p>\n<p class=\"p1\">To Do: To stay sober, we must change our thoughts and actions so that the feelings which used to drive us to use can't control us.

You probably will forget what's troubling you, but you probably won't forget if you let the symptoms of depression make you drink, eat, drug, spend hours on the internet, ruin your sleep, make you lose interest in things you used to enjoy, and otherwise ruin your day. Most times, it is the initial shock that hurts when we are confronted with an issue. Often, it is a little thing that starts us spiraling downward. It is important to not \"sweat the small stuff\". It is important to nip bad feelings in the bud.  </p>\n<p class=\"p3\">           <span class=\"Apple-converted-space\"> </span></p>\n<p class=\"p3\">           TO DO: You should use a <b>recovery tool</b> to get over the shock and forget what's bothering you, like sharing the problem with a friend, going to a meeting, journaling, deep breathing and more. Writing down something that bothers you and throwing it in the trash might help. Don't sweep your problems under the rug, deal with them one at a time. But there is a time to forget about them. Writing down 5 things you are grateful for (like being able to walk, living in a safe place, having food, etc.) may change your attitude.</p>\n<p class=\"p2\"><br></p>\n<p class=\"p4\"><br></p>\n</body>\n</html>\n",

Learning is easier than faking knowing. Our addiction is tied to trying to look important. We drank and used because our egos wanted us to be more than what we were willing to accept. We had to put on facades, fake fronts to try to impress others. We tried to appear as if we knew it all, were totally in control, and were all powerful. But inside we knew differently so we escaped by using. The truth is that others knew we were frauds too. We ended up humiliated. In recovery, we turn this humiliation into humility. We recognize that we can accept ourselves even though we are not as important as we thought we had to be. We learn to appreciate ourselves for who we are, not some egomaniacal version of who we would like to be and who we would like others to think we are. We become openminded to learning, and this actually makes us feel better.<span class=\"Apple-converted-space\"> </span></p>\n<p class=\"p2\"><br></p>\n<p class=\"p1\">To Do: Ask someone for help, and follow their suggestion. Exercising humility will bring us closer to our personal Higher Power which will keep us sober and remove our self defeating behaviors.</p>\n<p class=\"p2\"><br></p>\n<p class=\"p3\"><br></p>\n</body>\n</html>\n",

Don't let that confusion make you use. Remember, no one has all the answers. And anyone, who thinks he does, is misleading himself. If you are unsure of whether or not you are an addict, don't automatically deny that you are. Rather, give treatment a chance and see if your life is easier (with less bad consequences) when you are not using. If you are confused about whether or not you can have a Higher Power, remember that you don't have to have a perfect idea of one. Many addicts use the group as a Higher Power. Ask yourself whether or not your drug of choice had become a harmful Higher Power and whether or not it's time to pick a healing Higher Power. If you think you know how to stay sober on your own, you probably have a lot to learn, particularly if you have tried to stop using on your own before. So get to treatment and a meeting. If you think you are going to make the perfect decision with results that will work out exactly as planned, you have a lot to learn.<span class=\"Apple-converted-space\"> </span></p>\n<p class=\"p2\"><br></p>\n<p class=\"p1\">To Do: It's time to let go of knowing everything.

This will relieve stress and frustration.</p>\n<p class=\"p4\"><br></p>\n<p class=\"p5\">TO DO: Set a healthy goal and head in that direction living each moment according to the 4 absolutes: Honesty, Purity, Unselfishness, and Love.

Once we rebalance our ego, we will lose fear, anger and resentment because we won't be so obsessed with what happened, what is happening, or what will be happening to the almighty ME.

If you've never seen the inside of a baseball, it is tightly wound around a tiny rock hard center. You are like that baseball in that you have layer after layer of fears and resentments that are strangling your core (your true self). Your core can deal with reality; but your addiction consists of the layers of fears and resentments which make your core impotent. Once you cut through those layers by doing the 12 steps (particularly 4-7 and a daily 10<sup>th</sup>), you will free your core.<span class=\"Apple-converted-space\">  </span>And you will find that your core is this joyous being that can deal quite happily with reality without drugs.</p>\n<p class=\"p2\"><br></p>\n<p class=\"p4\">TO DO: Don't let your core strangle. Do a fourth step, a \"searching and fearless\" moral inventory to discover all your fears and resentments which are strangling your wonderful core. Then do a fifth step by admitting those fears and resentments to yourself, your Higher Power, and another trusted human being. This will free your core. And remember to do this process on a daily basis (the 10<sup>th</sup> step), so that you can keep your core free when new fears and resentments creep back into your life.</p>\n</body>\n</html>\n",

Soon the pain will pass. There will be no explanation for your suffering so don't even try to find one. Crying is absolutely acceptable. Owning your feelings without attaching any intellectual sense to them is sometimes quite healthy. Know that soon your pain will pass. Know that when it passes you will have a greater appreciation for not having that pain.

This in turn will change how you feel. If I am resentful, I must think about resentment in a different way. Instead of bathing in it and feeling worse and worse, I must think about getting out of that bath and substituting resentment with empathy. But this change of thinking is only the beginning. I must combine my change of thinking with a new action whenever I begin to feel resentment. That new action may be praying for the person I resent to heal. It may be doing something else positive for my life so that I don't think about the resentment. It may be forgiving the person.</p>\n<p class=\"p2\"><br></p>\n<p class=\"p1\">To Do: To stay sober, we must change our thoughts and actions so that the feelings which used to drive us to use can't control us.

If you've never seen the inside of a baseball, it is tightly wound around a tiny rock hard center. You are like that baseball in that you have layer after layer of fears and resentments that are strangling your core (your true self). Your core can deal with reality; but your addiction consists of the layers of fears and resentments which make your core impotent. Once you cut through those layers by doing the 12 steps (particularly 4-7 and a daily 10<sup>th</sup>), you will free your core.<span class=\"Apple-converted-space\">  </span>And you will find that your core is this joyous being that can deal quite happily with reality without drugs.</p>\n<p class=\"p2\"><br></p>\n<p class=\"p4\">TO DO: Don't let your core strangle. Do a fourth step, a \"searching and fearless\" moral inventory to discover all your fears and resentments which are strangling your wonderful core. Then do a fifth step by admitting those fears and resentments to yourself, your Higher Power, and another trusted human being. This will free your core. And remember to do this process on a daily basis (the 10<sup>th</sup> step), so that you can keep your core free when new fears and resentments creep back into your life.</p>\n</body>\n</html>\n",

No need to immediately intellectualize a response; just absorb it until the instinct to fight or flight passes. If these instincts don't pass, call someone safe like a sponsor or friend to discuss the problem. This strategy will keep the problem from becoming trouble. Fight or flight does not work as well as compromise.</p>\n<p class=\"p2\">To Do: Imagine the shock is a snake. Most snakes are harmless. In any event, you don't need to run away or lash out at it. Just gently support your head and breathe slowly and the snake will be hypnotized. We can't do anything productive in shock. We must let it pass. Only when the instinct to fight or flee passes can we think of a rational, sober solution to a problem.</p>\n<p class=\"p3\"><br></p>\n</body>\n</html>\n",

In fact, things NEVER work out exactly as planned. So, if you are thinking life is not fair or life doesn't make sense and that this is a good reason to use, then you are not being entirely realistic. You are asking for more than what life can give you. It's OK to make plans, but you can't be God so you can't control the results. Trying to control results and people causes frustration, anger, fear, and resentment.</p>\n<p class=\"p4\"><br></p>\n<p class=\"p3\">TO DO: To feel better, have faith that your loving Higher Power has a better plan for you; it's just that you may not be able to see it yet.

Start by looking at your feet, squeezing your foot muscles, then slowly working your way upward. Take your time, breathing slowly. Once you have reached the top of your head, start noticing your surroundings. Then do your next daily activity, keeping your mind focused on what you are doing.

Sobriety requires us to focus less about ourselves and our rights. Sobriety asks us to just deal positively with the experience.

Once we rebalance our ego, we will lose fear, anger and resentment because we won't be so obsessed with what happened, what is happening, or what will be happening to the almighty ME.

Soon the pain will pass. There will be no explanation for your suffering so don't even try to find one. Crying is absolutely acceptable.

Know that when it passes you will have a greater appreciation for not having that pain.

If you've never seen the inside of a baseball, it is tightly wound around a tiny rock hard center. You are like that baseball in that you have layer after layer of fears and resentments that are strangling your core (your true self). Your core can deal with reality; but your addiction consists of the layers of fears and resentments which make your core impotent. Once you cut through those layers by doing the 12 steps (particularly 4-7 and a daily 10<sup>th</sup>), you will free your core.<span class=\"Apple-converted-space\">  </span>And you will find that your core is this joyous being that can deal quite happily with reality without drugs.</p>\n<p class=\"p2\"><br></p>\n<p class=\"p4\">TO DO: Don't let your core strangle. Do a fourth step, a \"searching and fearless\" moral inventory to discover all your fears and resentments which are strangling your wonderful core. Then do a fifth step by admitting those fears and resentments to yourself, your Higher Power, and another trusted human being. This will free your core. And remember to do this process on a daily basis (the 10<sup>th</sup> step), so that you can keep your core free when new fears and resentments creep back into your life.</p>\n</body>\n</html>\n",

Just gently support your head and breathe slowly and the snake will be hypnotized. We can't do anything productive in shock. We must let it pass.

Often with the best of intentions, we tell people what to do.

A good way to relax is to ask yourself if you really are in trouble or is it just your anxious brain talking? Addicts overanalyze. We worry about outcomes. We try to control what we cannot. We tend to think negatively. We tend to think we are worthless if we make a mistake. We tend to ignore good things, and dwell on bad things. Addicts use and act out to try to change their irritating brains. Unfortunately, substances and addictive behaviors not only change our brains but cause us to break laws, end up in hospitals, lose God, and ruin relationships. A better way to change our brains is to surround ourselves with recovering people who care about us, exercise, eat correctly, practice the 12 steps, and share our secrets with Sponsors.</p>\n<p class=\"p2\"><br></p>\n<p class=\"p1\">To Do: Tell yourself to stop thinking. Get out of your head and into your heart. Instead reach out to help someone or do something to serve your Higher Power. Sometimes that service can be not making a problem worse or just taking a break for a peaceful walk or some other fun activity.</p>\n<p class=\"p2\"><br></p>\n<p class=\"p3\"><br></p>\n</body>\n</html>\n",

In fact, things NEVER work out exactly as planned. So, if you are thinking life is not fair or life doesn't make sense and that this is a good reason to use, then you are not being entirely realistic. You are asking for more than what life can give you. It's OK to make plans, but you can't be God so you can't control the results. Trying to control results and people causes frustration, anger, fear, and resentment.</p>\n<p class=\"p4\"><br></p>\n<p class=\"p3\">TO DO: To feel better, have faith that your loving Higher Power has a better plan for you; it's just that you may not be able to see it yet. Remember your concept of God does not have to be a traditional, religious concept (although it can be); God can be any positive, healthy force you want that helps return you to sanity.</p>\n<p class=\"p4\"><br></p>\n<p class=\"p4\"><br></p>\n<p class=\"p4\"><br></p>\n<p class=\"p5\"><br></p>\n</body>\n</html>\n",

Exercise mindfulness. Mindfulness means that you are slowly breathing and keeping your mind in the moment. Start by looking at your feet, squeezing your foot muscles, then slowly working your way upward. Take your time, breathing slowly. Once you have reached the top of your head, start noticing your surroundings. Then do your next daily activity, keeping your mind focused on what you are doing. Don't live in the future or the past.</p>\n<p class=\"p3\"><br></p>\n<p class=\"p4\"><br></p>\n</body>\n</html>\n",

Sobriety requires us to focus less about ourselves and our rights. Sobriety asks us to just deal positively with the experience. When we simply live the experience without making it all about me, we avoid \"pity parties\" or \"egocentric grandiosity\" which used to lead us to use. Once we rebalance our ego, we will lose fear, anger and resentment because we won't be so obsessed with what happened, what is happening, or what will be happening to the almighty ME. We will change into a more relaxed person as we gain humility.

Writing down 5 things you are grateful for (like being able to walk, living in a safe place, having food, etc.) may change your attitude.</p>\n<p class=\"p2\"><br></p>\n<p class=\"p4\"><br></p>\n</body>\n</html>\n",

You are like that baseball in that you have layer after layer of fears and resentments that are strangling your core (your true self). Your core can deal with reality; but your addiction consists of the layers of fears and resentments which make your core impotent. Once you cut through those layers by doing the 12 steps (particularly 4-7 and a daily 10<sup>th</sup>), you will free your core.<span class=\"Apple-converted-space\">  </span>And you will find that your core is this joyous being that can deal quite happily with reality without drugs.</p>\n<p class=\"p2\"><br></p>\n<p class=\"p4\">TO DO: Don't let your core strangle. Do a fourth step, a \"searching and fearless\" moral inventory to discover all your fears and resentments which are strangling your wonderful core. Then do a fifth step by admitting those fears and resentments to yourself, your Higher Power, and another trusted human being. This will free your core. And remember to do this process on a daily basis (the 10<sup>th</sup> step), so that you can keep your core free when new fears and resentments creep back into your life.</p>\n</body>\n</html>\n",

No matter how much you think you can control your feelings, no matter how well adjusted you think you are, no matter how well you like the 12 steps, every now and then something will happen that will upset you. The key is to not let that bird build a nest in your head. People, places, and things cannot control your emotions. They are just emotional triggers. Remember, you make yourself feel a certain way in response to the trigger. You can also quickly change how you respond.</p>\n<p class=\"p4\"><br></p>\n<p class=\"p3\"><span class=\"Apple-tab-span\">\t</span>TO DO:<span class=\"Apple-converted-space\">  </span>What's a good way to get that bird to fly away? One way is to try to recognize your feeling, and then to try to change the bad feeling to a positive feeling. To do so, you can start by using this app. You can also ask yourself if the trigger is worth being upset about. You can also try applying the 12 steps to the feeling. First, admit that you are powerless to handle it alone. Then, turn the problem over to a Higher Power. That Higher Power may be a consultation with a sponsor, a therapist, or your God.<span class=\"Apple-converted-space\">  </span>Maybe take an inventory and see where your own sensitivity may be contributing to the problem. If you can determine what the character sensitivity or issue is, tell someone else. If you can't determine what it is, discuss the situation with someone else. Try to find<span class=\"Apple-converted-space\">  </span><span class=\"s1\">your </span>defect and not the defect in the person you think is causing the problem. Once you find the defect, ask God to remove it.</p>\n<p class=\"p3\"><span class=\"Apple-tab-span\">\t</span>If the problem causes resentment, pray for the person who you think is causing the resentment.<span class=\"Apple-converted-space\"> </span></p>\n<p class=\"p3\"><span class=\"Apple-tab-span\">\t</span><span class=\"Apple-converted-space\">    </span>Remember to ask God that His will be done, not yours. And most importantly, try to help someone who is new to recovery. By getting out of yourself and helping another, you may be grateful that your problem is not as bad as the other person. You may gain perspective. Your attention will be re-focused.<span class=\"Apple-converted-space\">  </span>By doing what it takes to get the bird off your head, you will avoid finding yourself saying, <b>\"If I get drunk, I won't be able to think about it.\"</b></p>\n<p class=\"p5\"><br></p>\n</body>\n</html>\n",

Always test your first thought by thinking of its consequences (good and bad) and always think of possible alternative thoughts before you act. Especially with addicts, our first thoughts tend to be harmful to ourselves and others. For example, usually our first thought when confronted with stress, anger or some other negative emotion is to lash out, withdraw, or escape by picking up our first drug of choice. This just causes more conflict, stress, anger and resentment. We consequently regret acting upon our first thoughts. Acting upon our first thought is called a <i>reaction.<span class=\"Apple-converted-space\">  </span></i>In recovery, we learn to \"act upon\", not react, and this makes our lives easier. When our lives are easier, we don't want to act out to avoid life so we stay sober and we make better decisions.</p>\n<p class=\"p2\"><br></p>\n<p class=\"p1\"><span class=\"Apple-tab-span\">\t</span>To Do: Move on to the second thought.

Addicts tend to be control freaks. We think we know what's right and how to do it and what everyone else should do. We want to run the show. Often with the best of intentions, we tell people what to do. The only problem is that we forget that they usually don't want to hear what we have to say- especially if we are newly sober because we have made such a mess out of our own lives that we have nothing to back up what we are saying.</p>\n<p class=\"p3\"><span class=\"Apple-tab-span\">\t</span>The twelve steps teach us that we are not in charge- that everyone (including ourselves) is much better off if we turn our control over to our Higher Power.<span class=\"Apple-converted-space\">  </span>Usually, this means that we just try to do what's in front of us without controlling people, places or things. Rather, we should just accept what is and remember everything is not about us or our way.</p>\n<p class=\"p3\"><span class=\"Apple-tab-span\">\t</span>Getting out of the way means letting go of our need to control things we cannot. This keeps us from picking up the first drink because we lose the frustration that comes with doing the impossible. We can then accept life without drinking to escape from not getting our way.</p>\n<p class=\"p4\"><span class=\"Apple-tab-span\">\t</span></p>\n<p class=\"p3\">TO DO: Say to yourself: I will get out of the way and let my Higher Power handle the results.<span class=\"Apple-converted-space\"> </span></p>\n<p class=\"p4\"><br></p>\n<p class=\"p5\"><br></p>\n</body>\n</html>\n",

A good way to relax is to ask yourself if you really are in trouble or is it just your anxious brain talking? Addicts overanalyze. We worry about outcomes. We try to control what we cannot. We tend to think negatively. We tend to think we are worthless if we make a mistake. We tend to ignore good things, and dwell on bad things. Addicts use and act out to try to change their irritating brains. Unfortunately, substances and addictive behaviors not only change our brains but cause us to break laws, end up in hospitals, lose God, and ruin relationships. A better way to change our brains is to surround ourselves with recovering people who care about us, exercise, eat correctly, practice the 12 steps, and share our secrets with Sponsors.</p>\n<p class=\"p2\"><br></p>\n<p class=\"p1\">To Do: Tell yourself to stop thinking. Get out of your head and into your heart. Instead reach out to help someone or do something to serve your Higher Power. Sometimes that service can be not making a problem worse or just taking a break for a peaceful walk or some other fun activity.</p>\n<p class=\"p2\"><br></p>\n<p class=\"p3\"><br></p>\n</body>\n</html>\n",

Once you have reached the top of your head, start noticing your surroundings. Then do your next daily activity, keeping your mind focused on what you are doing.

Not a good result huh?</p>\n<p class=\"p2\"><span class=\"Apple-tab-span\">\t</span>Now, ask yourself what step (of the 12 steps) can I apply to this issue. It might be a good idea to start with step 4 to see what character defect is causing you to struggle. Then you might need to get rid of that defect by doing steps 5-7. Usually over controlling is a problem, so step 1 applies: powerlessness over people, places, and things.</p>\n<p class=\"p3\"><br></p>\n<p class=\"p4\">To Do: Live the steps and apply each step beginning with step one to specific issues. This will reduce stress and help you make better decisions.

You probably will forget what's troubling you, but you probably won't forget if you let the symptoms of depression make you drink, eat, drug, spend hours on the internet, ruin your sleep, make you lose interest in things you used to enjoy, and otherwise ruin your day. Most times, it is the initial shock that hurts when we are confronted with an issue. Often, it is a little thing that starts us spiraling downward. It is important to not \"sweat the small stuff\". It is important to nip bad feelings in the bud.  </p>\n<p class=\"p3\">           <span class=\"Apple-converted-space\"> </span></p>\n<p class=\"p3\">           TO DO: You should use a <b>recovery tool</b> to get over the shock and forget what's bothering you, like sharing the problem with a friend, going to a meeting, journaling, deep breathing and more. Writing down something that bothers you and throwing it in the trash might help. Don't sweep your problems under the rug, deal with them one at a time. But there is a time to forget about them. Writing down 5 things you are grateful for (like being able to walk, living in a safe place, having food, etc.) may change your attitude.</p>\n<p class=\"p2\"><br></p>\n<p class=\"p4\"><br></p>\n</body>\n</html>\n",

A good way to relax is to ask yourself if you really are in trouble or is it just your anxious brain talking? Addicts overanalyze. We worry about outcomes. We try to control what we cannot. We tend to think negatively. We tend to think we are worthless if we make a mistake. We tend to ignore good things, and dwell on bad things. Addicts use and act out to try to change their irritating brains. Unfortunately, substances and addictive behaviors not only change our brains but cause us to break laws, end up in hospitals, lose God, and ruin relationships. A better way to change our brains is to surround ourselves with recovering people who care about us, exercise, eat correctly, practice the 12 steps, and share our secrets with Sponsors.</p>\n<p class=\"p2\"><br></p>\n<p class=\"p1\">To Do: Tell yourself to stop thinking. Get out of your head and into your heart. Instead reach out to help someone or do something to serve your Higher Power. Sometimes that service can be not making a problem worse or just taking a break for a peaceful walk or some other fun activity.</p>\n<p class=\"p2\"><br></p>\n<p class=\"p3\"><br></p>\n</body>\n</html>\n",

Most times, it is the initial shock that hurts when we are confronted with an issue. Often, it is a little thing that starts us spiraling downward. It is important to not \"sweat the small stuff\". It is important to nip bad feelings in the bud.  </p>\n<p class=\"p3\">           <span class=\"Apple-converted-space\"> </span></p>\n<p class=\"p3\">           TO DO: You should use a <b>recovery tool</b> to get over the shock and forget what's bothering you, like sharing the problem with a friend, going to a meeting, journaling, deep breathing and more. Writing down something that bothers you and throwing it in the trash might help. Don't sweep your problems under the rug, deal with them one at a time. But there is a time to forget about them. Writing down 5 things you are grateful for (like being able to walk, living in a safe place, having food, etc.) may change your attitude.</p>\n<p class=\"p2\"><br></p>\n<p class=\"p4\"><br></p>\n</body>\n</html>\n",

For example, watch out for the 13<sup>th</sup> step (trying to pick up members of the opposite sex at meetings). Perhaps nothing can throw a newly recovering addict out of balance more than the emotional vicissitudes of a new sexual relationship. Accordingly, an adage heard at meetings is \" no new relationships for the first year.\"</p>\n<p class=\"p3\">TO DO: Focus on keeping an emotional \"even keel\". If you are tempted to act out sexually or to start a new relationship, ask yourself if it is worth your sobriety?</p>\n<p class=\"p4\"><br></p>\n</body>\n</html>\n",

We even stress when things are good. A good way to relax is to ask yourself if you really are in trouble or is it just your anxious brain talking? Addicts overanalyze. We worry about outcomes. We try to control what we cannot. We tend to think negatively. We tend to think we are worthless if we make a mistake. We tend to ignore good things, and dwell on bad things. Addicts use and act out to try to change their irritating brains. Unfortunately, substances and addictive behaviors not only change our brains but cause us to break laws, end up in hospitals, lose God, and ruin relationships. A better way to change our brains is to surround ourselves with recovering people who care about us, exercise, eat correctly, practice the 12 steps, and share our secrets with Sponsors.</p>\n<p class=\"p2\"><br></p>\n<p class=\"p1\">To Do: Tell yourself to stop thinking. Get out of your head and into your heart. Instead reach out to help someone or do something to serve your Higher Power. Sometimes that service can be not making a problem worse or just taking a break for a peaceful walk or some other fun activity.</p>\n<p class=\"p2\"><br></p>\n<p class=\"p3\"><br></p>\n</body>\n</html>\n",

A good way to relax is to ask yourself if you really are in trouble or is it just your anxious brain talking? Addicts overanalyze. We worry about outcomes. We try to control what we cannot. We tend to think negatively. We tend to think we are worthless if we make a mistake. We tend to ignore good things, and dwell on bad things. Addicts use and act out to try to change their irritating brains. Unfortunately, substances and addictive behaviors not only change our brains but cause us to break laws, end up in hospitals, lose God, and ruin relationships. A better way to change our brains is to surround ourselves with recovering people who care about us, exercise, eat correctly, practice the 12 steps, and share our secrets with Sponsors.</p>\n<p class=\"p2\"><br></p>\n<p class=\"p1\">To Do: Tell yourself to stop thinking. Get out of your head and into your heart. Instead reach out to help someone or do something to serve your Higher Power.

Don't let that confusion make you use. Remember, no one has all the answers. And anyone, who thinks he does, is misleading himself. If you are unsure of whether or not you are an addict, don't automatically deny that you are. Rather, give treatment a chance and see if your life is easier (with less bad consequences) when you are not using. If you are confused about whether or not you can have a Higher Power, remember that you don't have to have a perfect idea of one. Many addicts use the group as a Higher Power. Ask yourself whether or not your drug of choice had become a harmful Higher Power and whether or not it's time to pick a healing Higher Power. If you think you know how to stay sober on your own, you probably have a lot to learn, particularly if you have tried to stop using on your own before. So get to treatment and a meeting. If you think you are going to make the perfect decision with results that will work out exactly as planned, you have a lot to learn.<span class=\"Apple-converted-space\"> </span></p>\n<p class=\"p2\"><br></p>\n<p class=\"p1\">To Do: It's time to let go of knowing everything.

Just do the next right thing and concentrate on what you are doing. Exercise mindfulness. Mindfulness means that you are slowly breathing and keeping your mind in the moment. Start by looking at your feet, squeezing your foot muscles, then slowly working your way upward. Take your time, breathing slowly. Once you have reached the top of your head, start noticing your surroundings. Then do your next daily activity, keeping your mind focused on what you are doing. Don't live in the future or the past.</p>\n<p class=\"p3\"><br></p>\n<p class=\"p4\"><br></p>\n</body>\n</html>\n",

Passing out is not even real sleep. It's fretful delirium. The best antidote to the \"poor me's\" and fear, anger, perfectionism, resentment,<span class=\"Apple-converted-space\">  </span>boredom, and most negative feelings is gratitude, and gratitude for \"waking up\" is a great way to start our day.</p>\n<p class=\"p2\"><br></p>\n<p class=\"p3\">To Do: When you open your eyes after sober sleep, quickly thank God by praying, \"Thanks for letting me wake up and not come to.\" This will start your day with joy (gratitude for a gift).<span class=\"s1\"><span class=\"Apple-converted-space\"> </span></span></p>\n<p class=\"p4\"><br></p>\n</body>\n</html>\n",

No matter how much you think you can control your feelings, no matter how well adjusted you think you are, no matter how well you like the 12 steps, every now and then something will happen that will upset you. The key is to not let that bird build a nest in your head. People, places, and things cannot control your emotions. They are just emotional triggers. Remember, you make yourself feel a certain way in response to the trigger. You can also quickly change how you respond.</p>\n<p class=\"p4\"><br></p>\n<p class=\"p3\"><span class=\"Apple-tab-span\">\t</span>TO DO:<span class=\"Apple-converted-space\">  </span>What's a good way to get that bird to fly away? One way is to try to recognize your feeling, and then to try to change the bad feeling to a positive feeling. To do so, you can start by using this app. You can also ask yourself if the trigger is worth being upset about. You can also try applying the 12 steps to the feeling. First, admit that you are powerless to handle it alone. Then, turn the problem over to a Higher Power. That Higher Power may be a consultation with a sponsor, a therapist, or your God.<span class=\"Apple-converted-space\">  </span>Maybe take an inventory and see where your own sensitivity may be contributing to the problem. If you can determine what the character sensitivity or issue is, tell someone else. If you can't determine what it is, discuss the situation with someone else. Try to find<span class=\"Apple-converted-space\">  </span><span class=\"s1\">your </span>defect and not the defect in the person you think is causing the problem. Once you find the defect, ask God to remove it.</p>\n<p class=\"p3\"><span class=\"Apple-tab-span\">\t</span>If the problem causes resentment, pray for the person who you think is causing the resentment.<span class=\"Apple-converted-space\"> </span></p>\n<p class=\"p3\"><span class=\"Apple-tab-span\">\t</span><span class=\"Apple-converted-space\">    </span>Remember to ask God that His will be done, not yours. And most importantly, try to help someone who is new to recovery. By getting out of yourself and helping another, you may be grateful that your problem is not as bad as the other person. You may gain perspective. Your attention will be re-focused.<span class=\"Apple-converted-space\">  </span>By doing what it takes to get the bird off your head, you will avoid finding yourself saying, <b>\"If I get drunk, I won't be able to think about it.\"</b></p>\n<p class=\"p5\"><br></p>\n</body>\n</html>\n",

No need to immediately intellectualize a response; just absorb it until the instinct to fight or flight passes. If these instincts don't pass, call someone safe like a sponsor or friend to discuss the problem. This strategy will keep the problem from becoming trouble. Fight or flight does not work as well as compromise.</p>\n<p class=\"p2\">To Do: Imagine the shock is a snake. Most snakes are harmless. In any event, you don't need to run away or lash out at it. Just gently support your head and breathe slowly and the snake will be hypnotized. We can't do anything productive in shock. We must let it pass. Only when the instinct to fight or flee passes can we think of a rational, sober solution to a problem.</p>\n<p class=\"p3\"><br></p>\n</body>\n</html>\n",

Always test your first thought by thinking of its consequences (good and bad) and always think of possible alternative thoughts before you act.

This just causes more conflict, stress, anger and resentment. We consequently regret acting upon our first thoughts. Acting upon our first thought is called a <i>reaction.<span class=\"Apple-converted-space\">  </span></i>In recovery, we learn to \"act upon\", not react, and this makes our lives easier.

Addicts tend to be control freaks. We think we know what's right and how to do it and what everyone else should do. We want to run the show. Often with the best of intentions, we tell people what to do. The only problem is that we forget that they usually don't want to hear what we have to say- especially if we are newly sober because we have made such a mess out of our own lives that we have nothing to back up what we are saying.</p>\n<p class=\"p3\"><span class=\"Apple-tab-span\">\t</span>The twelve steps teach us that we are not in charge- that everyone (including ourselves) is much better off if we turn our control over to our Higher Power.<span class=\"Apple-converted-space\">  </span>Usually, this means that we just try to do what's in front of us without controlling people, places or things. Rather, we should just accept what is and remember everything is not about us or our way.</p>\n<p class=\"p3\"><span class=\"Apple-tab-span\">\t</span>Getting out of the way means letting go of our need to control things we cannot.

A good way to relax is to ask yourself if you really are in trouble or is it just your anxious brain talking? Addicts overanalyze. We worry about outcomes. We try to control what we cannot. We tend to think negatively. We tend to think we are worthless if we make a mistake. We tend to ignore good things, and dwell on bad things. Addicts use and act out to try to change their irritating brains. Unfortunately, substances and addictive behaviors not only change our brains but cause us to break laws, end up in hospitals, lose God, and ruin relationships. A better way to change our brains is to surround ourselves with recovering people who care about us, exercise, eat correctly, practice the 12 steps, and share our secrets with Sponsors.</p>\n<p class=\"p2\"><br></p>\n<p class=\"p1\">To Do: Tell yourself to stop thinking. Get out of your head and into your heart. Instead reach out to help someone or do something to serve your Higher Power. Sometimes that service can be not making a problem worse or just taking a break for a peaceful walk or some other fun activity.</p>\n<p class=\"p2\"><br></p>\n<p class=\"p3\"><br></p>\n</body>\n</html>\n",

Start by looking at your feet, squeezing your foot muscles, then slowly working your way upward. Take your time, breathing slowly. Once you have reached the top of your head, start noticing your surroundings. Then do your next daily activity, keeping your mind focused on what you are doing.

You probably will forget what's troubling you, but you probably won't forget if you let the symptoms of depression make you drink, eat, drug, spend hours on the internet, ruin your sleep, make you lose interest in things you used to enjoy, and otherwise ruin your day. Most times, it is the initial shock that hurts when we are confronted with an issue. Often, it is a little thing that starts us spiraling downward. It is important to not \"sweat the small stuff\". It is important to nip bad feelings in the bud.  </p>\n<p class=\"p3\">           <span class=\"Apple-converted-space\"> </span></p>\n<p class=\"p3\">           TO DO: You should use a <b>recovery tool</b> to get over the shock and forget what's bothering you, like sharing the problem with a friend, going to a meeting, journaling, deep breathing and more. Writing down something that bothers you and throwing it in the trash might help. Don't sweep your problems under the rug, deal with them one at a time. But there is a time to forget about them. Writing down 5 things you are grateful for (like being able to walk, living in a safe place, having food, etc.) may change your attitude.</p>\n<p class=\"p2\"><br></p>\n<p class=\"p4\"><br></p>\n</body>\n</html>\n",

We think if we make a bad decision the whole World will think we are stupid. A good way to relax is to ask yourself if you really are in trouble or is it just your anxious brain talking? Addicts overanalyze. We worry about outcomes. We try to control what we cannot. We tend to think negatively. We tend to think we are worthless if we make a mistake. We tend to ignore good things, and dwell on bad things. Addicts use and act out to try to change their irritating brains. Unfortunately, substances and addictive behaviors not only change our brains but cause us to break laws, end up in hospitals, lose God, and ruin relationships. A better way to change our brains is to surround ourselves with recovering people who care about us, exercise, eat correctly, practice the 12 steps, and share our secrets with Sponsors.</p>\n<p class=\"p2\"><br></p>\n<p class=\"p1\">To Do: Tell yourself to stop thinking. Get out of your head and into your heart. Instead reach out to help someone or do something to serve your Higher Power. Sometimes that service can be not making a problem worse or just taking a break for a peaceful walk or some other fun activity.</p>\n<p class=\"p2\"><br></p>\n<p class=\"p3\"><br></p>\n</body>\n</html>\n",

No matter how much you think you can control your feelings, no matter how well adjusted you think you are, no matter how well you like the 12 steps, every now and then something will happen that will upset you. The key is to not let that bird build a nest in your head. People, places, and things cannot control your emotions. They are just emotional triggers. Remember, you make yourself feel a certain way in response to the trigger. You can also quickly change how you respond.</p>\n<p class=\"p4\"><br></p>\n<p class=\"p3\"><span class=\"Apple-tab-span\">\t</span>TO DO:<span class=\"Apple-converted-space\">  </span>What's a good way to get that bird to fly away? One way is to try to recognize your feeling, and then to try to change the bad feeling to a positive feeling. To do so, you can start by using this app. You can also ask yourself if the trigger is worth being upset about. You can also try applying the 12 steps to the feeling. First, admit that you are powerless to handle it alone. Then, turn the problem over to a Higher Power. That Higher Power may be a consultation with a sponsor, a therapist, or your God.<span class=\"Apple-converted-space\">  </span>Maybe take an inventory and see where your own sensitivity may be contributing to the problem. If you can determine what the character sensitivity or issue is, tell someone else. If you can't determine what it is, discuss the situation with someone else. Try to find<span class=\"Apple-converted-space\">  </span><span class=\"s1\">your </span>defect and not the defect in the person you think is causing the problem. Once you find the defect, ask God to remove it.</p>\n<p class=\"p3\"><span class=\"Apple-tab-span\">\t</span>If the problem causes resentment, pray for the person who you think is causing the resentment.<span class=\"Apple-converted-space\"> </span></p>\n<p class=\"p3\"><span class=\"Apple-tab-span\">\t</span><span class=\"Apple-converted-space\">    </span>Remember to ask God that His will be done, not yours. And most importantly, try to help someone who is new to recovery. By getting out of yourself and helping another, you may be grateful that your problem is not as bad as the other person. You may gain perspective. Your attention will be re-focused.<span class=\"Apple-converted-space\">  </span>By doing what it takes to get the bird off your head, you will avoid finding yourself saying, <b>\"If I get drunk, I won't be able to think about it.\"</b></p>\n<p class=\"p5\"><br></p>\n</body>\n</html>\n",

Addicts tend to be control freaks. We think we know what's right and how to do it and what everyone else should do. We want to run the show. Often with the best of intentions, we tell people what to do. The only problem is that we forget that they usually don't want to hear what we have to say- especially if we are newly sober because we have made such a mess out of our own lives that we have nothing to back up what we are saying.</p>\n<p class=\"p3\"><span class=\"Apple-tab-span\">\t</span>The twelve steps teach us that we are not in charge- that everyone (including ourselves) is much better off if we turn our control over to our Higher Power.<span class=\"Apple-converted-space\">  </span>Usually, this means that we just try to do what's in front of us without controlling people, places or things.

Exercise mindfulness. Mindfulness means that you are slowly breathing and keeping your mind in the moment. Start by looking at your feet, squeezing your foot muscles, then slowly working your way upward. Take your time, breathing slowly. Once you have reached the top of your head, start noticing your surroundings. Then do your next daily activity, keeping your mind focused on what you are doing. Don't live in the future or the past.</p>\n<p class=\"p3\"><br></p>\n<p class=\"p4\"><br></p>\n</body>\n</html>\n",

Think about how you used to handle it while you were using. Not a good result huh?</p>\n<p class=\"p2\"><span class=\"Apple-tab-span\">\t</span>Now, ask yourself what step (of the 12 steps) can I apply to this issue. It might be a good idea to start with step 4 to see what character defect is causing you to struggle. Then you might need to get rid of that defect by doing steps 5-7. Usually over controlling is a problem, so step 1 applies: powerlessness over people, places, and things.</p>\n<p class=\"p3\"><br></p>\n<p class=\"p4\">To Do: Live the steps and apply each step beginning with step one to specific issues. This will reduce stress and help you make better decisions. It will also keep little things from building up, overwhelming you, frustrating you, confusing you and leading you to want to escape by using.</p>\n</body>\n</html>\n",

You probably will forget what's troubling you, but you probably won't forget if you let the symptoms of depression make you drink, eat, drug, spend hours on the internet, ruin your sleep, make you lose interest in things you used to enjoy, and otherwise ruin your day. Most times, it is the initial shock that hurts when we are confronted with an issue. Often, it is a little thing that starts us spiraling downward. It is important to not \"sweat the small stuff\". It is important to nip bad feelings in the bud.  </p>\n<p class=\"p3\">           <span class=\"Apple-converted-space\"> </span></p>\n<p class=\"p3\">           TO DO: You should use a <b>recovery tool</b> to get over the shock and forget what's bothering you, like sharing the problem with a friend, going to a meeting, journaling, deep breathing and more. Writing down something that bothers you and throwing it in the trash might help. Don't sweep your problems under the rug, deal with them one at a time. But there is a time to forget about them. Writing down 5 things you are grateful for (like being able to walk, living in a safe place, having food, etc.) may change your attitude.</p>\n<p class=\"p2\"><br></p>\n<p class=\"p4\"><br></p>\n</body>\n</html>\n",
