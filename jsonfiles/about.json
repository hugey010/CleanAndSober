The &quot;clean brain&quot; wants to stay clean and sober and free from trouble. This app causes us to use our &quot;clean brain&quot; particularly when our &quot;dirty brain&quot; invades. It substitutes the threatening thought with a truthful, rescuing thought. It changes our perception of a situation from something distressful to something manageable and even positive. It does this with ease and speed.&nbsp;</span></p>
